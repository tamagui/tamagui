- fix compiler on bootstrap repo not accepting packages/app
- use style values instead of classnames when non-extracted
  - think of <YStack x={cursor.position} /> we'll generate infinite classnames
  - also aligns with stylex

- 1.0
  - document XGroup, YGroup
  - html props: role, tabIndex, input type
  - <Input /> variant doesnt override paddingHorizontal set on same input
  - make SimpleTooltip inverse by default
    - make all inverse by default? i think so? or else make sub-themes handle it...
  - input type="email", button type="submit" etc
    - its fine to wrap input in HOC like button
    - normalize divergent android/ios:
      - https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput
        - android accepts "autoComplete"
        - ios accepts "textContentType"
        - set secureTextEntry automatically for type="password"
  - form onSubmit
  - shorthands-only type/docs
  - tokens-only type/docs
  - fix /types import
  - make Label work on native with touch event (require single <Label.Provider> at root)
    - make sure Select, Input, Switch etc all work with it
  - document $body being default font family
  - better docs on @tamagui/stacks (Sizable, ThemeableSizable, export variants)
  - add more of a kitchen sink demo to starts
  - test Android in starters repo
  - size=5.5 icon scales diff
  - size={55} doesnt set size only icon
  - theme light needs darker shadows?
  - much better PropsTable (expo has nice ones https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/)
  - <Select />, <Dialog /> (AlertDialog)
  - maybe <ToggleGroup />
  - maybe <Slider />
  - maybe <Blur />, <Tabs />, <Toast />, <RadioGroup />, <Progress />
  - <LinearGradient /> colors accept theme types
  - <Spacer /> doesnt work w media query display none
  - compiler work visually hidden
  - 0% bug // TODO i think media + pseudo needs handling here
  - maybe <UL /> <LI /> <OL />
  - focusStyle on native
  - document exported helpers getTokens, useThemeName, getFontSize, spacedChildren

(potentially 1.0)
  - createTamagui({ defaultProps: { Button: {} } }) for any component
  - `space` should work with media queries
  - Text numberOfLines / context fix
  - OmitShorthands<> + expandShorthands helper (latter exists already diff name...) (see ActiveCirlce in site)
    - Docs/ability to configure stricted theme values (dont accept anything but tokens)
  - as={} + extraction + types
  - add fonts section to guides
  - move away from rnw css generation
  - move away from supporting some react native APIs for performance
    - alternatively could test just doing this:
      - compiler could insert special props like:
        - __noAnimations, __noTheme, __noSpace
        - it would change key={} alongside that
        - that way HMR still works, but loads less hooks
        - works in production for extra perf
  - auto skeleton components

takeout:
  - customizable createTheme()
  - cli: 
    - tamagui generate
      - JSDocs / TSMorph
    - tamagui serve
      - able to focus in on any component without needing to restart anything
      - localhost:3000/FuzzyComponentName
    - tamagui test ./packages/site/components/OffsetBox.tsx
    - tamagui debug ./packages/site/components/OffsetBox.tsx
  - ios/android specific themes
  - basic styled() extraction to css at compile time
  - compiler hot reload
  - VSCode
    - move from functional component to styled() and back
    - built in jsx => css converter
    - "move to my design system" (finds tamagui package.json and moves there)
      - grab a selection of any styled() or functional component
      - moves it into your design system
      - updates index.ts there
      - updates imports in app
  - <Combobox /> (<SelectInput /> or <InputSelect />)
  - <Scale />

- <GradientText /> can work native with 
  - https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view
- react-native-skia / svg image support
- before={{}}, after={{}} could work ...
  - only if we can do with psuedos:
    - focusStyle={{ after: { fullscreen: true, border... } }}
    - allows for proper focused borders that don't require super hacks
    - see Switch
- styled(Button) types break   
- <Card />, <List />, <Radio />, <Avatar />
  - radio may be List.Radio just combines List, Label, Drawer
    - can use Switch or check or custom
- docs: extractable(), deoptProps, getExpandedShorthands
- <Accordion />
- <Carousel />
- load theme hook via feature if possible
- styleq / react-native-web 18 exploration
- <Video />, <Spinner />
- instead of generating classname strings generate objects
  - instead of concatClassNames then just object ...
- fix memory leak causing OOM eventually on site
- // this can be done with CSS entirely right?
- optional 18-only separate releases? beta.3.react18?
  - react native doesn't support it yet except on new arch
  - (useId/useInsertionEffect)
- escape hatch for html props `htmlProps` or tag={} => as={} + work better?
- whenever switch over to styleq or own internal css generator:
  - remove getStylesAtomic altogether - loop only once over props/styles
- exported hooks - useControllableState, useLayout
- <SizableFrame />, <EnsureFlexed />
- document/release <ThemeReverse />
- container queries
- <List /> (works with drawer + draggable + selectable)
- <Menu />
- <PopoverDrawer /> + <MenuDrawer />
- // TODO only on hoverable/pressable!
- options to render to native components in more places
- <Group />
- transformOrigin
  - may be able to translate to matrix https://www.jianshu.com/p/c67559b8f691
  - https://github.com/sueLan/react-native-anchor-point
- space => gap (blocked https://github.com/facebook/yoga/pull/1116)
- Text selectColor
- focusWithinStyle
- accessibility upgrades (focus rings etc)
- colored cli output
- have tamagui watch the tamagui.config.ts file and report if types break
- smart responsive scaling system (<Scale /> basically)
- https://github.com/react-native-menu/menu
- vscode plugin to highlight the current node your cursors inside of in dom
- blur prop built in ?
