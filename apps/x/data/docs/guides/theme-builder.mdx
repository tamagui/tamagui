<IntroParagraph>
  The new theme-builder package makes creating suites of themes for Tamagui far
  easier, with some performance benefits to boot.
</IntroParagraph>

With version 1.37 Tamagui has released two new things to help make authoring themes much easier:

- `createThemeBuilder` - a chainable theme creation API exported from `@tamagui/theme-builder`.
- `themeBuilder` - option for the Tamagui compiler to watches and generate themes.

The new ThemeBuilder makes it much easier to generate a suite of themes. Meanwhile the `themeBuilder` option automates pre-generating themes, which means you can avoid some runtime cost and bundle size.

This guide goes into `createThemeBuilder`. If you want to [skip to the API, check here](#createthemebuilder), or you can just copy-paste [a complete example here](#complete-example).

<Notice>
  You don't need to create your own theme suite. You can use our built-in themes
  or roll your own by hand. Or you can just avoid themes altogether! This guide
  is for more advanced use cases where you want to generate a very custom look
  and feel for your app.
</Notice>

Before we dive in, here's a minimal createThemeBuilder example to understand what we're building towards. It generates `light`, `dark`, `light_subtle`, and `dark_subtle` themes using all the concepts we'll cover in this guide: palettes, templates, masks, and themes:

<Notice>
  Note that the @tamagui/theme-builder package requires TypeScript 5 or greater
  for const generic support.
</Notice>

```tsx
import { createSoftenMask, createThemeBuilder } from '@tamagui/theme-builder'

const themesBuilder = createThemeBuilder()
  .addPalettes({
    dark: ['#000', '#111', '#222', '#999', '#ccc', '#eee', '#fff'],
    light: ['#fff', '#eee', '#ccc', '#999', '#222', '#111', '#000'],
  })
  .addTemplates({
    base: {
      background: 0,
      color: -0,
    },
  })
  .addMasks({
    soften: createSoftenMask(),
  })
  .addThemes({
    light: {
      template: 'base',
      palette: 'light',
    },
    dark: {
      template: 'base',
      palette: 'dark',
    },
  })
  .addChildThemes({
    subtle: {
      mask: 'soften',
    },
  })

export const themes = themesBuilder.build()
```

And to set up your compiler to automatically watch and build your themes, add the following to your compiler config (for example with Next.js):

```tsx
withTamagui({
  config: './tamagui.config.ts',
  components: ['tamagui'],

  // input is the file that imports @tamagui/theme-builder
  // and has an `export const themes`
  // output is then the file you import and use with your `createTamagui`
  themeBuilder: {
    input: './themes-input.tsx',
    output: './themes.tsx',
  },
})
```

You can also use the new `@tamagui/cli` package to enable `npx tamagui generate-themes ./src/themes-in.ts ./src/themes-out.ts`.

### The Concepts

The way the new ThemeBuilder works is through three main concepts: a palette, a template, and a mask. It's worth understanding each and how they relate to a design system before getting your hands dirty.

But first - what is a theme?

#### Themes

A theme is simple. It's a static typed object with properties that map from name => color. The simplest example of a theme is this:

```tsx
{
  background: '#000',
  color: '#fff',
}
```

You can have as many values as you want in your themes, but what's important is that they share the same shape. Of course Tamagui themes [get more interesting with their support of sub-themes](/docs/intro/themes), but the important things to remember are that themes share the same shape, and that sub-themes can be subsets of parent themes.

While we mostly deal with colors in this tutorial, themes can also take other strings or numbers as values. For now, this guide only focuses on color.

#### Palettes

The first layer of building a theme starts with a palette. A palette is typically a gradient within a single color, going from background to foreground, though it could also include contrasting colors if you so desired.

Here's an example of a blue palette:

<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette showLabels />

You can toggle dark mode in the top left of the site to see that in fact we have _two_ blue palettes: `light_blue` and `dark_blue`.

Here's that same palette in code (the `dark_blue` one):

```tsx
const dark_blue = [
  'hsl(212, 35.0%, 9.2%)', // background
  'hsl(216, 50.0%, 11.8%)',
  'hsl(214, 59.4%, 15.3%)',
  'hsl(214, 65.8%, 17.9%)',
  'hsl(213, 71.2%, 20.2%)',
  'hsl(212, 77.4%, 23.1%)',
  'hsl(211, 85.1%, 27.4%)',
  'hsl(211, 89.7%, 34.1%)',
  'hsl(206, 100%, 50.0%)',
  'hsl(209, 100%, 60.6%)',
  'hsl(210, 100%, 66.1%)',
  'hsl(206, 98.0%, 95.8%)', // foreground
]
```

Palettes are great for a design system because they constrain your color choices to a consistent scale. Designs look better when they have constraints.

We can refer to a single color in the pallete by 0-index:

<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette showIndices />

In this case 0 is the background, and 11 is the foreground.

Within Tamagui you can define your palettes to have as many or few colors as you like. You also technically don't _have_ to go from background to foreground, but we recommend it if only for being consistent (and for being able to use our built-in masks, which we'll get into shortly).

The offical `@tamagui/themes` theme suite that this websites uses adds one more layer to this equation - the 0-index color is actually a "background transparent", leaving the 1st index as the actual background, and correspondingly, the 12th index is the strongest foreground, while the 13th is "foreground transparent".

#### Templates

The next level up from a palette is a template. Templates are also pretty simple, they are used to generate a theme from a palette. They map a _name to an index in your palette_. The names can be whatever you want, and the index just refers to an offset of your palette.

In practice, it looks something like this:

```tsx
{
  background: 0,
  color: 12
}
```

The `tamagui` components have standardized on the following minimum theme, so if you are generating themes for use with the tamagui components, you'll want to have your templates fill in these colors:

```tsx
{
  background: string
  backgroundFocus: string
  backgroundHover: string
  backgroundPress: string
  borderColor: string
  borderColorFocus: string
  borderColorHover: string
  borderColorPress: string
  color: string
  colorFocus: string
  colorHover: string
  colorPress: string
  colorTransparent: string
  placeholderColor: string
  shadowColor: string
  shadowColorFocus: string
  shadowColorHover: string
  shadowColorPress: string
}
```

We could make a quick and hard-coded function that takes a template + palette and returns a theme, just to illustrate how they are used:

```tsx
const createTheme = (palette: string[], colorTemplate: {
  background: number
  color: number
}) => ({
  background: palette[colorTemplate.background],
  color: palette[colorTemplate.color],
})

createTheme(dark_blue)
// => {
//   background: 'hsl(212, 35.0%, 9.2%)',
//   color: 'hsl(206, 98.0%, 95.8%)'
// }
```

So, why do this? Well, if we have more than one theme, we likely want to use the same template over and over. This generally makes sense when you match the lightness/saturation, but have a different hue. Even your base `light` and `dark` theme could share the same template.

The Tamagui site shares templates across all the color themes:

<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette theme="blue" />
<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette theme="red" />

In this case, we'd call `createTheme` with the same template, just changing out the red or blue palette:

```tsx
const colorTemplate = {
  background: 0,
  color: 12,
}

const blue_theme = createTheme(bluePalette, colorTemplate)
const red_theme = createTheme(redPalette, colorTemplate)
```

This is nice. We can share a template but pass in different palettes, ensuring we can generate consistent themes but swap out for different palettes.

Still, the real utility of templates becomes most clear when we get into sub-themes.

#### Sub-themes

Let's take a quick detour. Tamagui themes can nest as many times as you want. This lets you do some amazing things. We can set up a "subtle" sub-theme that turns anything inside it to have a lower contrast feel:

```tsx
const dark = {
  background: 'black',
  color: 'white',
}

const dark_subtle = {
  background: '#222', // not as dark as black
  color: '#ccc', // not as light as white
}

createTamagui({
  themes: {
    dark,
    dark_subtle,
  },
})
```

Note the `_subtle`. An underscore defines a sub-theme, so `dark_subtle` is a sub-theme of `dark`. In your code you can now do this:

```tsx
import { View, Theme, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

const Square = styled(View, {
  background: '$background',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
})

export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    {/* this will have a background of black */}
    <Square />

    <Theme name="subtle">
      {/* this will have a background of #222 */}
      <Square />
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
)
```

Sub-themes are amazing - they avoid a trap that you can fall into when designing screens where you decide you want a different look for an area, so you go off and change all the color values. But then later on you want to share that area somewhere else, or perhaps you just change your mind and want to revert the feel. In those two cases you'd either be stuck refactoring the whole area to accept two or more sets of ternaries on every color value, or you'd have to manually go through and change all the values by hand.

Instead with a sub-theme, you can throw `<Theme name="subtle">` around the entire area without having to change any of the code inside of it at all.

Where it gets interesting is in a final feature of sub-themes: component themes, which are really just sub-themes in disguise.

Taking our example above, we can add a `name` to our `styled` call:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

const Square = styled(View, {
  name: 'Square',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
})
```

And just like that, if we define a `_Square` sub-theme, any usage of `<Square />` will pick it up:

```tsx
// in your tamagui.config.ts:

const dark_Square = {
  background: 'darkblue',
}

createThemes({
  dark,
  dark_Square,
})

// in your app:

export default () => (
  <>
    <Theme name="dark">
      <Square />
      {/*

          Because Square has a name of Square it looks for a sub-theme with _Square.
          It will find dark_Square and change the theme.

          So in this case the Square backgroundColor will be 'darkblue'.

        */}
    </Theme>
  </>
)
```

This is how Tamagui "solves" themes. It gives you incredible power to re-skin the entire interface without having to touch any code. It's not mandatory - you can always just go in and change the color values inline as you please. But it does mean that we (and your team) can ship components and screens that can be completely re-skinned at any point in the tree.

Think of it as a super-power. If you don't use it, there's no downside. But if you do, you gain a pretty powerful new ability.

#### Masks

Ok, with the knowledge of sub-themes in hand, we're ready to see how masks fill in the final piece of the puzzle for letting us generate an entire suite of themes that give us base themes, sub-themes, and component themes.

Masks do one thing: they take an existing template, apply transformation, and return a new one. We could create a simple mask called "shift-right" that takes this template:

```tsx
{
  background: 0,
  color: 6,
}
```

And does this:

```tsx
shiftRightMask({
  background: 0,
  color: 5,
})
/**
 * => {
 *   background: 1,
 *   color: 6
 * }
 */
```

Is it useful? Not really, but it explains what they do.

To understand their utility we can revisit component themes. Let's build it up again. We start with our base theme, `dark_blue`. It uses a template with background `0` and color `11`, which gives us a nice dark background and bright color.

Now we want to theme a `dark_blue_Button`. We want our Button to stand out from the `dark_blue` theme, so we want to shift our background from `0` to be something above it: maybe 1, or 2. We can create a new mask function called `strengthenBackground` that is defined somewhat like this.

Keep in mind this is just a hard-coded example of a mask for simplicity:

```tsx
const strengthenBackground = (template) => ({
  background: template.background + 1,
})
```

So now we can do:

```tsx
const darkPalette = ['black', '#222', '#444', '#666', '#888', '#aaa', 'white']

const baseTemplate = {
  background: 0,
  color: 6,
}

const dark = createTheme(baseTemplate, darkPalette)

// dark = { background: 'black', color: 'white' }

const buttonTemplate = strengthenBackground(baseTemplate)

const dark_Button = createTheme(buttonTemplate, darkPalette)

// dark_Button = { background: '#222', color: 'white' }
```

The ThemeBuilder basically gives you generic versions of masks much like this.

There's one last wrinkle though: what if we want to make the backgrounds lighter, but the foregrounds softer? How can masks do this in a generic way, without having to assume things about how you name your keys?

Let's revisit our palette.

<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette showIndices />

We want a mask called `subtlerMask` that takes a template and makes backgrounds increment while foregrounds decrement - if we have a template with background 0 and color 11, then our `subtlerMask` should return background 1 and color 10.

The issue here is that the only way we could "know" to move the background +1 and the color -1 is if we had some logic that basically checked "if index < 50%, +1, else -1". Except what if we have a foreground that's at 50%? We'd end up shifting it the wrong way!

So this is where we introduce one final concept with templates, negative indices:

<Blog.ThemeBuilder.ExamplePalette showIndices showNegativeIndices />

By adding the idea of a negative index that represents a foreground (while positive indices represent backgrounds), we can change our template as follows:

```tsx
{
  background: 0,
  color: -0,
}
```

It's pretty easy from here to modify our example `createTheme` function to handle negative indices:

```tsx
const createTheme = (palette: string[], template: Record<string, number>) => {
  const res = {}
  for (const key in template) {
    const index = template[key]
    res[key] = index < 0 ? palette[palette.length - 1 + index] : palette[index]
  }
  return res
}
```

Now we have everything we need. We'll just make the mask `subtlerMask` "know" when a value is meant to be a foreground or a background by checking if negative, and making it shift appropriately:

```tsx
subtlerMask({
  background: 0,
  color: -0,
})
/**
 * => {
 *   background: 1,
 *   color: -1
 * }
 */
```

And that's all masks really are - functions that take a template and return a template.

They help us especially with sub-themes and component themes, where often you want to take an existing theme, like `dark`, and then return a `dark_Button` theme where the background is a bit stronger, and maybe the color a bit softer. So long as we define our templates using positive values for backgrounds and negative values for foregrounds, masks have all the info they need to make transformations.

In `@tamagui/theme-builder` we've included a variety of masks we found useful:

- `createInverseMask` - Flips background and foreground.
- `createSoftenMask` - Makes background and foreground move closer to center.
- `createStrengthenMask` - Makes background and foreground move further from center.

We also export two helper functions for creating your own masks:

- `createMask` - Passes some standardized options and a template to the mask function you give it.
- `combineMasks` - Combine two masks.

### A bit of history

Or "why we landed on all of these concepts".

Tamagui has gone through many stages of "theme builders", ie functional APIs that let you generate a suite of themes. It means the current version is the result of a lot of iteration, and we think its led to a better outcome than if we had pushed out something quickly.

#### The first attempt

In the beginning there was simply a big imperative ball of goop that we recommended copy/pasting into your own app. We eventually put that behind a very ad-hoc and rigid single function that let you customize the base palettes, but nothing below that.

#### The second attempt

Our first attempt at formalizing the theme system came around version 1.2, with `@tamagui/create-theme`, which added a variety of concepts and helper functions. These basically let you generate your own full suite of themes from base palettes, as well as two new ideas, "templates" and "masks". Templates would simply pick values off a palette, where a mask could take a previous template and generate a new one based off of it.

These concepts were key in allowing for the new API to work. But still, it was a lot of work to put together a theme suite, and the resulting code was fairly verbose. We also never fully got around to documenting the system, as it was clear there were a variety of improvements to be made. So we still recommended just copy/pasting the themes config we built, and left users on their own.

#### The current attempt

With version 1.37 we're officially documenting and making a new ThemeBuilder first-class. It further builds off the work in `@tamagui/create-theme`, adding a layer above all the helper functions we previously created. Instead of having to import 6-7 different functions and compose them together yourself, you can import a single function, `createThemeBuilder`, which has a chained API that makes the resulting code far more elegant and readable.

It also has a variety of improvements - it makes it far easier to change your themes at any "level," while still sharing code at any other level. Further, it makes the idea of a palette and mask first class and named, which is key for us going forward with the [Studio](/studio). This means we can now have two-way sync with the Tamagui Studio - we can understand not just your themes, but the palettes, templates and masks you used the generate theme, but also, we can write back out to them if you change them within the visual affordances the Studio begets.

All in all this means that generating a complete suite of themes is now not only easy, but within reach of anyone, even designers! This is especially true as it's super easy to actually keep all the masks and templates the same, but just swap out the root level palettes. We expect an explosion of theme suites will bloom due to the big wins in ease of use enabled by the new `@tamagui/theme-builder`.

</Aside>

### createThemeBuilder

Now that we have all the required context to understand palettes, templates, and masks, we can get familiar with the `createThemeBuilder` API.

Let's get back to our minimal example:

```tsx
import { createSoftenMask, createThemeBuilder } from '@tamagui/theme-builder'

const themesBuilder = createThemeBuilder()
  .addPalettes({
    dark: ['#000', '#111', '#222', '#999', '#ccc', '#eee', '#fff'],
    light: ['#fff', '#eee', '#ccc', '#999', '#222', '#111', '#000'],
  })
  .addTemplates({
    base: {
      background: 0,
      color: -0,
    },
  })
  .addMasks({
    soften: createSoftenMask(),
  })
  .addThemes({
    light: {
      template: 'base',
      palette: 'light',
    },
    dark: {
      template: 'base',
      palette: 'dark',
    },
  })
  .addChildThemes({
    subtle: {
      mask: 'soften',
    },
  })

export const themes = themesBuilder.build()
```

This is the full API, minus some optional extra props that each function takes. Calling `themesBuilder.build()` will generate the following:

```tsx
{
  light: {
    background: '#fff',
    color: '#000',
  },
  dark: {
    background: '#000',
    color: '#fff',
  },
  light_subtle: {
    background: '#eee',
    color: '#111',
  },
  dark_subtle: {
    background: '#111',
    color: '#eee',
  },
}
```

#### Complete Example

To get a better idea of a complete theme suite, check out [the source for the `@tamagui/themes` package](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/themes/src/themes-new.ts). This is the code that produces the themes for this site. It handles a variety of more complex use cases:

- Adding multiple levels of themes, like `light_orange`, `light_subtle`, and `light_orange_subtle`.
- Adding component themes like `light_Button`, `light_orange_Button`, and `light_orange_subtle_Button`.
- Making the base (`light` and `dark`) themes have extra properties that are a superset of their children.
- Creating and uses custom masks using `combineMasks` and `createMask`.
- Diverging templates between light and dark by using the optional array syntax.
- Passing options to some masks to "skip" changing certain values in the templates.
- Using `avoidNestingWithin` to prevent combinations of sub-themes.
