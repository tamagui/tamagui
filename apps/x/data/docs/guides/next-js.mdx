description: How to set up Tamagui with Next.js
---

Check out the [source for this site](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site) to see a good example of a full featured Next.js website as well, especially the `next.config.js` and `tamagui.config.ts`.

## Install

<Notice>
        Running `npm create tamagui` let's you choose the `starter-free` starter which is a very nicely configured Next.js app where you can take or leave whatever you want.
</Notice>

Create a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### next.config.js

To configure Tamagui for Next.js, you'll want to add the `@tamagui/next-plugin` and set it up in your next config. See the [compiler install docs](/docs/intro/compiler-install) for more options:

```tsx showMore
module.exports = function (name, { defaultConfig }) {
    let config = {
        ...defaultConfig,
        // ...your configuration
    }

    const tamaguiPlugin = withTamagui({
        config: './tamagui.config.ts',
        components: ['tamagui'],
        // build-time generate CSS styles for better performance
        // we recommend only using this for production so you get reloading during dev mode
        outputCSS: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? './public/tamagui.css' : null,

        // optional advanced settings:

        // set to false if you never call addTheme or updateTheme
    })

    return {
        ...config,
        ...tamaguiPlugin(config),
    }
}
```

### pages/\_app.tsx

Add the reset to get more consistent styles across browsers:

```tsx
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'
```

And then add this if you are using the `outputCSS` option to include the CSS file generated at build-time:

```tsx
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    require('../public/tamagui.css')
}
```

### pages/\_document.tsx

You'll want to set up a `_document.tsx` and gather both the `react-native-web` style object using AppRegistry, as well as Tamagui styles using `Tamagui.getCSS()` into the head element.

Note that we only are importing `react-native` here because if you use `tamagui` views like Input or Image they rely on React Native Image/Input (and therefore on the web, `react-native-web`). If you are just using core, or aren't using Image or Input in `tamagui`, you can forego the entire `AppRegistry` import and setup here. We're working on making even `tamagui` completely de-coupled from RN/RNW by building their own image and input components eventually.

```tsx
import NextDocument, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import { Children } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

import Tamagui from '../tamagui.config'

export default class Document extends NextDocument {
    static async getInitialProps({ renderPage }) {
    const page = await renderPage()

    // @ts-ignore RN doesn't have this type
    const rnwStyle = StyleSheet.getSheet()

    return {
        ...page,
        styles: (
        <>
            <style
            id={rnwStyle.id}
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: rnwStyle.textContent }}
            />
            <style
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                __html: Tamagui.getCSS({
                // if you are using "outputCSS" option, you should use this "exclude"
                // if not, then you can leave the option out
                exclude: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'design-system' : null,
                }),
            }}
            />
        </>
        ),
    }
    }

    render() {
    return (
        <Html>
        <body>
            <Main />
            <NextScript />
        </body>
        </Html>
    )
    }
}
```

## Themes

We've created a package that works with Tamagui to properly support SSR light/dark themes that also respect user system preference, called `@tamagui/next-theme`. It assumes your `light`/`dark` themes are named as such, but you can override it. This is pre-configured in the create-tamagui starter.

We recommend memo-ing children so they don't re-render. Here's how you'd set up your `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import { NextThemeProvider, useRootTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from '../tamagui.config'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    const [theme, setTheme] = useRootTheme()

    // memo to avoid re-render on dark/light change
    const contents = useMemo(() => {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }, [pageProps])

    // because we do our custom getCSS() above, we disableInjectCSS here
    return (
    <>
        <Head>{/* ... */}</Head>
        <NextThemeProvider onChangeTheme={setTheme}>
        <TamaguiProvider
            config={config}
            disableInjectCSS
            disableRootThemeClass
            defaultTheme={theme}
        >
            {contents}
        </TamaguiProvider>
        </NextThemeProvider>
    </>
    )
}
```

If you need to access the current theme, say for a toggle button, you will then use the `useTheme` hook. We'll release an update in the future that makes this automatically work better with Tamagui's built-in `useTheme`.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'

export default () => {
    const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme()
    return <Button>Change theme (currently: {theme})</Button>
}
```

## Mount animations

Animations that run through JS drivers and have `enterStyle` set will want to add the following script that allows for hiding those animations before the JS runs. This is the "right way" to handle things, as it allows for disabling JS entirely and not accidentally hiding all unmounted things. Meanwhile, it still properly avoids a flash of mounted style for SSR pages.

Add this to your `_app.tsx` render output:

```tsx
<NextHead>
    <script
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        // avoid flash of entered elements before enter animations run:
        __html: `document.documentElement.classList.add('t_unmounted')`,
    }}
    />
</NextHead>
```

## Server components

Tamagui includes Server Components support for the Next.js app directory with `use client` support. We're working on a mode with limitations that enables full server support.

Create a new component:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

export function NextTamaguiProvider({ children }) {
    useServerInsertedHTML(() => {
    // the first time this runs you'll get the full CSS including all themes
    // after that, it will only return CSS generated since the last call
    return <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: Tamagui.getNewCSS() }} />
    })

    // see Tamagui provider setup in the example above
    return <TamaguiProvider>{children}</TamaguiProvider>
}
```

The new `getNewCSS` helper in Tamagui will keep track of the last call and only return new styles generated since the last usage.

And then use it in your `app/layout.tsx` like this:

```tsx
import { NextTamaguiProvider } from './NextTamaguiProvider'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
    return <NextTamaguiProvider>{children}</NextTamaguiProvider>
}
```

Additionally, you will need to add the `skipNextHead` prop to your `<NextThemeProvider>`, as the internal usage of `next/head` is not supported in the app directory.

And you'll need to pass the `appDir` boolean to `@tamagui/next-plugin`:

```tsx
withTamagui({
    appDir: true,
})
```
