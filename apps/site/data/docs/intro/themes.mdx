description: How to create and use themes in Tamagui.
---

Themes map neatly to CSS variables for your components: they should contain colors and other values that you'd want to contextually change at any point in your React tree.

All themes must be of the same type: all objects share the same set of keys and key to value types.

If you just want to dive in and copy a complete theme, check out the [Quick Start](#quick-start).

<Notice>
  This document introduces how themes work, but as of version 1.37 we've introduced a new
  way to create your themes that makes generating a full suite of themes much easier.
  [Read the guide](/docs/guides/theme-builder).
</Notice>

You can define a theme like this:

```tsx
const dark = {
  background: '#000',
  color: '#fff',
  // define any key to any string or number value
}
```

### Using tokens

Tokens are CSS variables that _don't change contextually_. Think of them as your constants. You should put _all_ your color values into tokens first, like so:

```tsx
const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    black: '#000',
    white: '#fff',
  },
})
```

Then, you can use them in any theme:

```tsx
const dark = {
  background: tokens.color.black,
  color: tokens.color.white,
}
```

Think of tokens as your base constants that share downwards.

## Subset themes

One of the real powers of Tamagui is theme nesting (we'll explain more on the importance and usage below). If you define a theme with the name in the form `[parentName]_[subName]`, Tamagui then accepts `<Theme name="[subName]" />` as though it's valid.

You can do this as many times as you'd like. For example you can have the following themes:

- `dark_green_subtle`
- `light_green_subtle`

And you're able to then access them (fully typed):

```tsx
<Theme name="dark">
  <Theme name="green">
    <Button theme="subtle">Hello world</Button>
  </Theme>
</Theme>
```

You can also access a specific subset more directly:

```tsx
<Theme name="dark">
  <Button theme="green_subtle">Hello world</Button>
</Theme>
```

#### Component themes

Every Tamagui `styled()` component looks for it's own specific theme if you pass it the `name` property. For example:

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  name: 'Circle',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
})
```

The `name` attribute will be removed from the defaultProps and used internally by Tamagui to check for a sub-theme that ends with `_Circle`.

Now you can create the default theme for all Circle components at any level of nesting:

```tsx
const dark_Circle = {
  background: 'darkred',
  color: 'white',
}

const light_Circle = {
  background: 'lightred',
  color: 'black',
}
```

<Notice>Component themes must have the first letter capitalized.</Notice>

- `dark_Circle`
- `dark_green_Circle`
- `dark_green_subtle_Circle`

This is an incredibly powerful and unique feature that allows authors of UI components control over design, while still letting users customize them completely.

---

While `@tamagui/core` isn't prescriptive at all, `tamagui` is. This is because standardizing on specific shared theme keys unlocks huge upside. We recommend authors to use these values as well, to enable maximum sharing.

In `tamagui`, all components will look for the following keys:

- `background`
- `color`
- `borderColor`
- `shadowColor`
- `placeholderColor` (no pseudo variants)

...plus all the pseudo variants for each, eg, `backgroundHover`, `backgroundPress`, and `backgroundFocus`.

You can of course do all of this yourself in your own design system with `styled`:

If you are building a component with more than one sub-components, you can follow this pattern:

```tsx
import { GetProps, Stack, Text, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const ButtonFrame = styled(Stack, {
  name: 'Button',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
})

const ButtonText = styled(Text, {
  name: 'ButtonText',
  color: '$color',
})

type ButtonProps = GetProps<typeof ButtonFrame>

// note: extractable will tell the tamagui compiler to optimize usages of this:
export const Button = ButtonFrame.extractable(({ children, ...props }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <ButtonFrame {...props}>
      <ButtonText>{children}</ButtonText>
    </ButtonFrame>
  )
})
```

And now you can add two themes: `dark_Button` and `dark_ButtonText`, and override their default styles.

## Quick start

To get started quickly, you can use the themes we've developed alongside this site and with other apps, `@tamagui/themes`. It's even easier to see how it all comes together by using [create-tamagui to bootstrap](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app).

To install, just add import it and add it to your `tamagui.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { color, radius, size, space, themes, zIndex } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  size,
  space,
  zIndex,
  color,
  radius,
})

const config = createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  // ... see Configuration
})

export type Conf = typeof config

declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default config
```

<Notice>
  If you want to customize the starter themes, we recommend you just grab the `src` for
  `@tamagui/themes` and copy/paste it into your app, and customize from there.
</Notice>

## Full Example

Let's start with an example of inline styling with a subset of the configuration:

```tsx
import { TamaguiProvider, createTokens, createTamagui, View, Theme } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    darkRed: '#550000'
    lightRed: '#ff0000'
  }
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

const config = createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      red: tokens.color.darkRed,
    },
    light: {
      red: tokens.color.lightRed,
    }
  }
})

export const App = () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config} defaultTheme="light">
    <View backgroundColor="$red" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <View backgroundColor="$red" />
    </Theme>
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

In this example we've set up darkRed and lightRed variables and a dark and light theme that use those variables. Tamagui will handle defining:

```css
:root {
  --colors-dark-red: #550000;
  --colors-light-red: #ff0000;
}

.tui_dark {
  --red: var(--colors-dark-red);
}

.tui_light {
  --red: var(--colors-light-red);
}
```

Which will automatically apply at runtime, or can be gathered for use in SSR using `Tamagui.getCSS()`.

Finally, the compiler on web will extract your views roughly as so:

```tsx
export const App = () => (
  <Provider defaultTheme="light">
    <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    </Theme>
  </Provider>
)

// CSS output:
//  .color-2nesi3 { background-color: var(--red); }
```

## Ensuring valid types

Here's what we've landed on which helps ensure everything is typed properly. Keep themes in a separate `themes.ts` file, and structure it like this:

```tsx
import { tokens } from './tokens'

const light = {
  background: '#fff',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray3,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray4,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray5,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray4,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray6,
  color: tokens.color.gray12,
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray11,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray10,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray6,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA5,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA6,
}

// note: we set up a single consistent base type to validate the rest:
type BaseTheme = typeof light

// the rest of the themes use BaseTheme
const dark: BaseTheme = {
  background: '#000',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray2Dark,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray3Dark,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray4Dark,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray3Dark,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray4Dark,
  color: '#ddd',
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray11Dark,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray10Dark,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray6Dark,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA6,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA7,
}

const dark_translucent: BaseTheme = {
  ...dark,
  background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.7)',
  backgroundHover: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
  backgroundPress: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.25)',
  backgroundFocus: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.1)',
}

const light_translucent: BaseTheme = {
  ...light,
  background: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.85)',
  backgroundHover: 'rgba(250,250,250,0.85)',
  backgroundPress: 'rgba(240,240,240,0.85)',
  backgroundFocus: 'rgba(240,240,240,0.7)',
}

// note the steps here
// we recommend doing this because it avoids a category of confusing type errors

// 1. to get ThemeNames/Theme, first create an object with all themes
const allThemes = {
  dark,
  light,
  dark_translucent,
  light_translucent,
  ...colorThemes,
}

// 2. then get the name type
type ThemeName = keyof typeof allThemes

// 3. then, create a Themes type that explicitly maps ThemeName => BaseTheme
type Themes = {
  [key in ThemeName]: BaseTheme
}

// 4. finally, export it with the stricter type
export const themes: Themes = allThemes
```

## Dynamic Themes

Sometimes you want to defer loading themes, or change existing theme values at runtime. Tamagui exports three helpers for this in the package `@tamagui/theme` which exports `addTheme`, `updateTheme`, and `replaceTheme`.

### addTheme

<HeroContainer>
  <AddThemeDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AddTheme

```

### updateTheme

<HeroContainer>
  <UpdateThemeDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=UpdateTheme

```

### replaceTheme

<HeroContainer>
  <ReplaceThemeDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=ReplaceTheme

```

### Notes

- Dynamic themes only work on the client side and will be ignored on the server side.
- The difference between `updateTheme` and `replaceTheme` is that `replaceTheme` will replace the entire theme, while `updateTheme` will only update the values that are passed in.
- On the web if you are going to change between dark and light themes more than 3 times, you'll want to adjust the `maxDarkLightNesting` option, see [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration).

### Advanced Optimization

You can configure Tamagui to not send any themes JS to the client side, so long as your are serving the resulting css file from the `getCSS` call on initial load of your app (SSR).

To enable this you need to have your bundler tree shake away the themes object you'd typically pass to `createTamagui` for the client bundle. Note this is a somewhat advanced optimization and not necessary to do right away.

For examle:

```tsx
import { themes as themesIn } from './your-themes-file'

// We leave this value empty for production client side bundles to save on bundle size.
// The `@tamagui/next-plugin` sets TAMAGUI_IS_SERVER automatically.
// If you pass an empty themes object Tamagui will try to hydrate by scanning CSS in browser environments.
// It typically takes low single-digit ms to scan and can save significantly on JS size.

const themes =
  process.env.TAMAGUI_IS_SERVER || process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
    ? themesIn
    : ({} as typeof themesIn)

export const config = createTamagui({
  themes,
  // ...
})
```
