description: How to get Tamagui set up.

Tamagui is a full-featured UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`.

If you want a complete set of components designed to build universal apps, use `tamagui`. If you want to build out your own components and don't want any of the `tamagui` components, you can just use `@tamagui/core`. [See the Design Systems guide](/docs/guides/design-systems) for more on how to configure Core.

This document uses `tamagui` as an example, but if you are using `@tamagui/core` you can swap out the import.

#### Saving bundle size for web-only use cases

If you are _only_ targeting the web: `@tamagui/web` is the same library as `@tamagui/core`, except that it drops support for a few React Native specific things, mostly props: namely the `GestureResponderHandlers` and `onLayout` props are absent, and the platform methods on refs like `measureInWindow` are absent. If you are only targeting web, you can swap every reference of `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` in this guide with `@tamagui/web`. Note that you can't use `@tamagui/web` with `tamagui` as the full `tamagui` package relies on many of these props.

### Quick Start

Try out [create-tamagui](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app) for a helpful starter template which comes with `@tamagui/shorthands` and `@tamagui/theme-base` for easy default configuration:

```bash
npm create tamagui@latest
```

This gives you everything pre-configured for full-stack apps with shared code.

## Install

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

Be sure to set the environment variable `TAMAGUI_TARGET` to the string `web` or `native`, respectively. You can usually just do this in your package.json script, swapping out the command for whichever bundler you use:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "TAMAGUI_TARGET=web webpack"
  }
}
```

If you're targeting a native app and installing `tamagui` (not core), you'll need to [set up `expo-linear-gradient` first](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-47/packages/expo-linear-gradient) as Metro will try and find it even if you don't import it.

### Config file

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project.
You can import `createTamagui` from either `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` depending on which you decide to use.

From there you'll export default the result of `createTamagui` like so:

```tsx
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/theme-base'
import { createFont, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
  fonts: {
    body: createFont({
      family: 'Arial',
      size: {
        // You'll want to fill these values in so you can use them
        // for now, fontSize="$4" will be 14px.
        // You can define different keys, but `tamagui`
        // standardizes on 1-15.
        4: 14,
      },
      lineHeight: {
        4: 16,
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

You'll need to install these packages if you want the Tamagui pre-configured design system:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/shorthands @tamagui/theme-base
```

For an even quicker start, you can get a full design system with `@tamagui/config-base`, which we show on the [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) page. That page also goes into more detail on everything `createTamagui` accepts.

### Root export

Import and use the `TamaguiProvider` component as the top component in your app.

```tsx line=8-14
// this provides some helpful reset styles to ensure a more consistent look
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'

import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* if you want nice React 18 concurrent hydration, you'll want Suspense near the root */}
      <Suspense>
        <AppContents />
      </Suspense>
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/core/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

### Done!

You're now ready to use Tamagui, import and use any components:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}
```

We recommend [spending time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration) from here, skipping over the Compiler setup. The compiler is optional and should be saved for setting up after you've built something you'd like to test it with.
