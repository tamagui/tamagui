description: Get Tamagui set up, step by step
---

We recommend using npm create to set up one or more of the example apps via `npm create tamagui@latest`. It's useful even if integrating into an existing app.

## Install

The base Tamagui style library `@tamagui/core` has only one dependency - `react`.

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

If you want `tamagui`, you can avoid installing core and instead use `tamagui` everywhere as it's a superset of core:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

For now recommended `yarn` if you are using Tamagui in a monorepo, as it's been proven on large projects where we've found issues with others.

Add `TamaguiProvider` and pass `config` to it at the root of your app and you are fully set up:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
// optional but recommended CSS reset:
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'
import { TamaguiProvider, View } from '@tamagui/core' // or 'tamagui'
import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
    <View width={200} height={200} backgroundColor="red" />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

Tamagui doesn't require any bundler setup for either web or native, but you'll typically want to configure a few things using `createTamagui` like media queries, fonts, or tokens. The [configuration documentation](/docs/core/configuration) covers this in detail, but if you'd like to get started with decent defaults, you'll want `@tamagui/config`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

Here's a basic setup with `@tamagui/config`:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider, createTamagui } from '@tamagui/core' // or 'tamagui'
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v3'

// you usually export this from a tamagui.config.ts file
const tamaguiConfig = createTamagui(config)

// make TypeScript type everything based on your config
type Conf = typeof tamaguiConfig
declare module '@tamagui/core' { // or 'tamagui'
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default () => {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={tamaguiConfig}>
      {/* your app here */}
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

You should be ready to use any component:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button theme="blue">Hello world</Button>
}
```

From here, we'd recommend [spending some time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration). Tamagui works 100% the same at runtime as at compile-time, so you can wait until you're needing some extra performance to [set up the compiler](/docs/intro/compiler-install).


## Guides

<Notice theme="green">
  Tamagui generally doesn't require any special bundler setup, but React Native Web and the ecosystem of React Native packages often do. Tamagui provides a variety of plugins for compatibility and simplifying compiler setup.
