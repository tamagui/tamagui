title: Tamagui Props
description: All the base props
---

Tamagui supports a superset of the React Native props. Start with:

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), or
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)

From there, we add [style props](/docs/intro/styles) directly onto the same object.

Finally, there are a few non-style props Tamagui adds:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'animation',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          Apply an animation as defined in your createTamagui configuration.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'animateOnly',
      required: false,
      type: 'string[]',
      description: (
        <span>
          A list of properties to animate. Note that flat transforms can only be controlled via `transform`.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'theme',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          Apply a theme or sub-theme to this component and the components below it.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'themeInverse',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          Invert light or dark theme for the sub-tree.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'themeShallow',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          Used in combination with the theme prop, it prevents the theme from passing to children.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'className',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: An escape hatch to set className. This works fully with the compiler, which will concat your defined className with its generated ones.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'tag',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Renders the final element as the given tag. Note: React Native Web doesn't support tag and as such if using any animation driver except CSS the tag prop will stop working. We'd recommend using "role" for most cases.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'space',
      required: false,
      type: "boolean | string | TamaguiConfig['space']",
      description: (
        <span>
          Deprecated, use gap instead -
          Spacing is built into Tamagui and can accept a number or Token.space value. This will
          filter out any nullish child elements and insert a spacer components between the remaining
          elements.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'spaceDirection',
      required: false,
      default: 'both',
      type: `'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'both'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          Deprecated - By default the space inserted is a square, but if you set it to horizontal it will be 0px tall, vertical will be 0px wide.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'debug',
      required: false,
      type: `boolean | 'verbose' | 'break'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          When set Tamagui will output a variety of helpful information on how it parsed and
          applied styling. Verbose will output more information, and break will hit a debugger at
          the start of render in development mode.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'asChild',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean | "except-style"',
      description: (
        <span>
          When true, Tamagui expects a single child element. Instead of rendering its own element, it will pass all props to that child, merging together any event handling props. When "except-style", the same behavior except Tamagui won't pass styles down from the parent, only non-style props.
        </span>
      ),
    },
