title: React, twice as fast
description: The Tamagui compiler reduces duplicate code while improving performance and platform-specific output.

<IntroParagraph>
  If you're developing a cross-platform app, you've made an implicit decision. This
  decision can be thought of as a **frontend development trilemma**, illustrated as a
  choose-two-of-three:
</IntroParagraph>

<YStack w="100%" mih={500} als="center" $gtMd={{ my: '$4' }}>
  <Image
    title="The Frontend Trilemma: Choose two of DX, UX, and multi-platform"
    src="/trilemma.svg"
    size="hero"
    height={270 * 2}
    width={320 * 2}
    resizeMode="contain"
  />
</YStack>

React Native recommends writing things twice generally for the best UX - as is made very clear in the `<title>` of the homepage itself: "[learn once, write anywhere](https://reactnative.dev/)" as opposed to "write once, runs everywhere". This pays off today with native-feeling and performing apps while saving quite a bit of dev time.

The center of the Venn diagram is a platonic ideal - <strong>"write once, runs _well_ everywhere"</strong>, and we're pretty far from it. We could imagine a few ways to get closer:

- A sort-of Rails-for-React with simple routing, patterns, code gen, "all the batteries".
- An all-encompassing UI kit that targeted each platform's primitives confidently with flexible APIs.
- A compiler that let you write comfy natural styles, even with logic, that optimize to each platform - perfect CSS on web, for example. Plus, it should flatten nested style views into `div` or `View`.

This document goes over the last one. The first one just sounds hard, and the second one [Tamagui UI](/docs/components/stacks) is working towards, slowly.

**The hope is to make another "bump" like the one React Native Web made here:**

<YStack w="100%" mih={220} my="$4" als="center" $gtMd={{ scale: 1.5, my: 100 }}>
  <Image
    title="How possible it is to share more code: a lot more with React Native, and again with React Native Web"
    src="/code-sharing2.svg"
    size="hero"
    height={220}
    width={380}
    resizeMode="contain"
  />
</YStack>

This can be done especially on the web by reducing JS bundle size by a large % and greatly increasing render performance with reduced tree depth, logic, objects, and hooks. The Tamagui Compiler does this using partial evaluation, static extraction and hoisting, code elimination, and tree-flattening.

Universal apps (those you "write once" that "run everywhere") make sense today for many cases: side-projecting, SEO-insensitive or enterprise-only apps, people who want to ship fast, experiment more, are pre-product-market fit, or generally have apps with simpler UI. Twitter and Tinder are two larger examples of this.

But today, at best, we use hooks for media queries and themes, which basically touch every component. This causes whole-tree re-renders and more expensive main-thread time in critical areas on the web. Combine that with the CSS-in-JS approach of React Native Web greatly increasing bundle size, and even medium-complexity pages will drop from 100% Lighthouse to half or worse (our homepage, a good complex example due to showing off many features that are well-optimized, goes from ~80% down to ~20% with the compiler off).

With all your media queries, interactive styles, themes, animations, and dynamic styles in JS, it's hard to make ambitious apps that don't feel janky.

### How Tamagui Helps

`@tamagui/static` is an optimizing compiler for React Native with four main features:

<YStack py="$4">
  <Features
    size="$5"
    items={[
      `Extracts all types of styling syntax into atomic CSS.`,
      `Removes a high % of inline styles with partial evaluation and hoisting.`,
      `Reduces tree depth, flattening expensive styled components into div or View.`,
      `Evaluates useMedia and useTheme hooks, turning logical expressions into media queries and CSS variables.`,
    ]}
  />
</YStack>

The output is smaller bundles, better runtime performance, and many more native primitives used on the web.

Here's what it does, in code:

<TamaguiExamplesCode />

See [more examples on the homepage](/).

Notice that the compiler turned the `Text` into a `p`, and the `YStack` into a `div` (on native, this would be `Text` and `View`). This is known as tree-flattening, and for both web and native it yields very nice improvements to render performance.

This is a typical performance improvement, where much of the gains come from flattening:

<YStack my="$2">
  <BenchmarkChartWeb />
</YStack>

Across a few apps, we've seen 30-50% of components typically flatten, with a higher percent achievable just by being aware of how the flattening optimizes (adding the `// debug` comment to the top of the file will show a fuller output).

Meanwhile, on Native, because we can't optimize to anything beyond vanilla React Native code, the gains are less. Still, the results are impressive given you now have performance within 5% of hand-optimizing React Native code, except you get a whole suite of features for free.

<YStack my="$2">
  <BenchmarkChartNative />
</YStack>

You can see [more Benchmarks with explanations here](/docs/intro/benchmarks).

The compiler itself deserves more detail, which we'll expand on in the blog. For now, this serves as a decent introduction.

Compilers can dramatically improve code sharing without the typical sacrifice of performance. They don't solve every problem of universal apps, but by making responsive styling, themes and interactive styles all perform at native levels, they unlock sharing a much larger percentage of the components located in the middle to bottom of the render tree in apps.

It gives us a new choice, "Universal + Compiler" that lets us ship fast while still feeling native:

<Table my="$6">
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head></TableCell>
    <TableCell>4</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Strategy</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Universal + Compiler</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Native + Web</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Code Sharing</TableCell>
    <TableCell>~60-90%</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Feels native</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Ship Fast</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
</Table>

So what about this whole "React, twice as fast" title? Well, while the Tamagui compiler does net nearly 2x performance in some areas, on average you're looking at more like a 50% gain in the average render time of a complex screen. But, **by letting you not worry about performance while at the same significantly reducing total frontend LOC**, you probably save more than another 50% on development time.

And that's the point: faster to input, faster output. Thank you Tamagui 🙏.

Give Tamagui a try with `npm create tamagui@latest`.
