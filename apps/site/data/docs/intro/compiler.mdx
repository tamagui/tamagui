<TLDR>

Tamagui's compiler makes sharing significantly more code between native and web **not** cost performance vs hand-optimized. It speeds up web apps 1-3x, and native ~1.25x.

</TLDR>

<IntroParagraph>
  Let's start with a choice all frontend developers make implicitly, presented three ways:
</IntroParagraph>

<Table heading="You can only choose two">
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell>Multi-platform</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell>Single codebase</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell>Feels native</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
</Table>

Or, as a choose-two-of-three:

<Table heading="Choose one">
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head></TableCell>
    <TableCell>1</TableCell>
    <TableCell>2</TableCell>
    <TableCell>3</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Strategy</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Universal</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Lean</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Big-Budget</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Native + Web</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
    <TableCell>❌</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Code Sharing</TableCell>
    <TableCell>\> 70%</TableCell>
    <TableCell>-</TableCell>
    <TableCell>\< 30%</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Ship Fast</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
    <TableCell>❌</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Feels native</TableCell>
    <TableCell>❌</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
</Table>

A diagram reveals a fourth option, with a center that is today largely impossible:

<YStack maw={650} als="center">
  ![The Frontend Trilemma: Choose two of DX, UX, and multi-platform (or run out of
  time).](/trilemma.svg)
</YStack>

You either target more platforms with one codebase and sacrifice UX/performance, or target each platform individually but double your time to ship each feature.

Many people choose the former, and it's unfortunate but understandable. For a variety of reasons: you're a small team, you have to ship, and supporting more platforms or testing your idea out is more important than absolute speed. Life's tough.

But I don't think it's necessary for React to be slow, even when sharing a lot of code. **Even using fancy CSS-in-JS solutions**. We just need some help - and compilers will do just that.

First, a chart:

<YStack maw={650} als="center">
  ![Sharing code between web and native without sacrificing native feel has gone way up with the
  release of React Native, and later with the release of React Native Web](/code-sharing.svg)
</YStack>

You can define your own "feels native" and set the Y axis appropriately, make small if you want. I put a general upward trend as all sort of amazing library authors have made sharing so much more performance and well-designed, a few being [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (+ [Solito](https://solito.dev/)), [React Native Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia) or [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and [many](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg) [many](https://github.com/expo/match-media) [many](https://gorhom.github.io/react-native-bottom-sheet) [many](https://github.com/rnmapbox/maps) [more](https://www.google.com/search?q=expo+linear+gradient&oq=expo+linear+gradient&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j69i60.3994j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

With React Native Web today it's hard to share more than a pretty small fraction of your frontend without immediately sacrificing look and feel.

This is mostly because of the web. The web is extra sensitive to performance, especially when it comes to Javascript, and the CSS-in-JS needs compilers to avoid shipping a lot more of it.

It's not just light bundles that are the limiting factor. <span style={{ color: 'var(--yellow10)' }}>Properly extracting even logic-filled components down to CSS for all of the following is even more important for overall app performance and responsivity</span>.

Extracting all of the following would unlock a huge amount of performance for a huge set of existing React apps in the wild today:

- Inline styles
- Responsive styles (media queries)
- Themes, colors, sizing (CSS variables)
- Interactive styles (pseudo styles)

Media queries are especially table-stakes for sharing code, but running them as hooks de-opts web-apps such that even simpler apps bring modern browsers to a halt on resize. Pseudo styles and theme styles are also in places very sensitive to re-renders (especially as interactive changes often animate).

### How the compiler works

Tamagui fixes many of these problems with a compiler. It optimizes four things:

- Static styles via the `styled` function
- Dynamic (inline) styles, using partial evaluation
- Hooks for themes or media queries
- Tree-depth (via tree-flattening)

It turns this:

##### Input

```tsx
import { Text, YStack } from '@tamagui/core'

const App = (props) => (
  <YStack
    padding={props.big ? '$5' : '$3'}
    {...(props.colored && {
      backgroundColor: 'green',
    })}
  >
    <Text
      color="green"
      $large={{
        color: 'yellow',
        $hover: {
          color: 'green',
        },
      }}
    >
      Lorem ipsum dolor.
    </Text>
  </YStack>
)
```

Intos something like this:

```tsx
import { YStack, concatClassName } from 'tamagui'

const App = (props) => (
  <div
    className={concatClassName(
      _cn + (props.big ? _cn2 : _cn3) + (' ' + (props.colored ? _cn4 : ' '))
    )}
  >
    <p className={_cn5}>Lorem ipsum dolor.</p>
  </div>
)

const _cn5 = ' _c-scmqyp _d-1471scf _ff-xeweqh _fs-7uzi8p _lh-1l6ykvy'
const _cn4 = '  _bc-1542mo4'
const _cn3 = ' _pb_-12bic3x _pl_-7ztw5e _pr-g6vdx7 _pt-1vq430g'
const _cn2 = ' _pb-z3qxl0 _pl-14km6ah _pr-1qpq1qc _pt-1medp4i'
const _cn = ' _bc-abc123 _d-6koalj _fd-eqz5dr _fls-1q142lx '
```

Along with CSS (which you can see, alongside more examples see [on the homepage](/)).

The tree flattening here (turning `Text` into `p`) dramatically increases render performance on the web, above the already large gains from CSS compilation. This is a benchmark of rendering a single view that has a few "variants." Typically, your app would have to render a large View with many hooks. With Tamagui, it just hands a `div` over to React:

<BenchmarkChartWeb />

Meanwhile, on Native, because we can't optimize to anything beyond vanilla React Native code, the gains are less. Still, the results are impressive given you are now getting a huge amount of features and nice syntax that normally would eat up a lot of performance, and the net result is basically even with hand-optimized React Native:

<BenchmarkChartNative />

Give Tamagui a try with `npm create tamagui-app`.
