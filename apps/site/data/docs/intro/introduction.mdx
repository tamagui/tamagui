#### Core

A lightweight (20Kb) yet complete CSS-in-JS library, design system library, and base components and hooks that work together. It works on top of React Native and React Native Web - or our hopefully temporary fork which reduces bundle size signifcantly [react-native-web-lite](/intro/compiler-install)).

Using [createTamagui](/docs/configuration) you can generate a fully-typed design system with colors, tokens, spacing, sizing, fonts, themes, shorthands, animations, and more, that work with well-optimized and easy to use hooks like [useMedia](/docs/core/use-media) and [useTheme](/docs/core/use-theme).

It works hand-in-hand with a lightweight yet full-featured [styled factory](/docs/core/styled) for CSS-in-JS with all features from variants and shorthand props to media queries, themes, pseudo styles and more, all nicely typed.

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  color: '$color9',
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

// use <Circle pin="top" size="$sm" />
```

The [Stack and Text components](/docs/core/stacks-and-text) exports work alongside `styled()` and provide lot of nice features like hover, press, and focus styles, nice inline style props with typed theme and token values, shorthands, media queries, animations, and more (the animations are powered by drivers which can be swapped out, like CSS transition on web, but react-native-reanimated on iOS).

It's a base layer with everything you need for building a full-featured design system.

#### Static

The `@tamagui/static` package is an optimizing compiler for React that does much more than just extracting CSS styles.

[Read in-depth on how it works and how fast it is here](/docs/intro/compiler).

#### Tamagui

Above that, [the Tamagui UI Kit](/docs/components/stacks) for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.
