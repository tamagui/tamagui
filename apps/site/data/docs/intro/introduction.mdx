## Overview

Tamagui aims to bring joy to cross platform development. Use the core style library or
any of the components in the `tamagui` UI kit independently or together. Styled or
unstyled, with React Native and React Native Web, or without either.

#### Core

Core (`@tamagui/core`) is a fully-typed TypeScript
[style and design system library](/docs/core/configuration), a bit like a modern
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com) or
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev). On native it depends on React Native, but on
web it has no dependency outside `react` itself - yet it supports the full React
Native API surface in 24-28Kb, depending on tree-shaking.

It primarly exports a `styled` function and `Text` and `View` components, all of
which accept Tamagui styles. Tamagui styles support a
[large superset](/docs/intro/styles) of the the React Native style API, bringing
many powerful abilities from CSS - like container queries.

Create a fully typed design system, re-theme your app or portions of your app
magically with nested themes, swap between three animation drivers, and gain
huge runtime performance with smart signal-based hooks for media queries and
themes.

Swap Core for `@tamagui/web` to drop support for the
[React Native prop APIs](/docs/intro/props) that Core supports and save bundle
size, for web-only sites and apps.

#### Static

Static (`@tamagui/static`) is an
[optimizing compiler for React](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler) that emits
0-runtime, near optimal code for both web and native, even when faced with
logic-filled styles or styles that import values from other files. It was forked
from the great [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle) library.

#### Tamagui

Tamagui (`tamagui`)
[is a suite of cross-platform React Native components](/docs/components/stacks)
that can come in styled or unstyled form.

It features novel components like Adapt, a primitive that lets a component
shapeshift their content into other forms depending on the media query or
platform and `native` props to adapt many components to their native
counterparts.
