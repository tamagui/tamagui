  features={[
    `Core only has one dependency - React - but supports the full React Native View and Text API, a superset of the React Native Style API, styled(), powerful hooks, and the typed design system helpers in ~28Kb on web.`,
    `A smart, partial-evaluating compiler gives 0-runtime performance with the ergonomics of writing your code however you want - even inline, logic-filled code is optimized.`,
    `Every feature works at runtime and compile-time, so none of the usual limits of 0-runtime libraries, while optionally getting the same great performance.`,
    `useTheme and useMedia hooks with signal-like granularity and dirty tracking.`,
    `Unstyled and styled versions of all components.`,
