description: How to set up Tamagui with Expo
---

If you'd like an example of an Expo web app albeit not kept up to date, [check out this repo](https://github.com/LunatiqueCoder/expotamagui). Before going your own, you may be better served using a [pre-made community Expo starter](/community) for inspiration as they typically are fully working and have figured out more details than are in this guide.

### Installing Tamagui in Expo

This guide assumes Expo is configured with TypeScript support.

```bash
npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

For instructions on adding TypeScript to an existing project, visit the [expo typescript documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/).

To support dark mode, update your `app.json` to `app.config.ts` and set userInterfaceStyle to automatic.

```ts
userInterfaceStyle: "automatic",
```

### Update Babel / Metro

The following steps are optional but useful for many apps, they enable the optimizing compiler, reanimated, as well as using `process.env.XYZ` for environment variables.

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/babel-plugin babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables
npx expo install react-native-reanimated
```

Update your `babel.config.js` to include the optional `@tamagui/babel-plugin` and `transform-inline-environment-variables` (and `react-native-reanimated` if using reanimated):

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
    plugins: [
      // optional, only if you ever use process.env
      "transform-inline-environment-variables",
      // NOTE: this is optional, you don't *need* the compiler
      [
        "@tamagui/babel-plugin",
        {
          components: ["tamagui"],
          config: "./tamagui.config.ts",
          logTimings: true,
        },
      ],
      // NOTE: this is only necessary if you are using reanimated for animations
      "react-native-reanimated/plugin",
    ],
  };
}

```

If you're using a monorepo you probably want to use this Metro configuration:

```ts
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname, {
  // [Web-only]: Enables CSS support in Metro.
  isCSSEnabled: true,
});

// Expo 49 issue: default metro config needs to include "mjs"
// https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23180
config.resolver.sourceExts.push('mjs');

module.exports = config;
```

### Setup Tamagui

From here on out you can follow the [Installation](/docs/intro/installation) and [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) docs.

#### Loading fonts

You need to load your fonts for React Native to recognize them. Typically this looks something like if using Expo, (or you can [follow a React Native guide here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35255645/how-to-set-default-font-family-in-react-native)):

```tsx
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'

function App() {
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    Inter: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Medium.otf"),
    InterBold: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Bold.otf"),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded) {
      // can hide splash screen here
    }
  }, [loaded])

  if (!loaded) {
    return null;
  }

  return <MyApp />
}
```

### First time starting Expo

The first time running your project with Tamagui, be sure to clear the cache:

```bash
 expo start -c
```

Your `package.json` scripts should look something like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start-native": "expo start -c",
    "start-web": "expo start -c",
    "android": "yarn expo run:android",
    "ios": "yarn expo run:ios",
    "web": "expo start --web"
  }
}
```

### Other resources

If you'd like to get a good idea of a set up with Expo, try out `npm create tamagui` which generates a managed expo project.

[The source for that is here](https://github.com/tamagui/starter-free).
