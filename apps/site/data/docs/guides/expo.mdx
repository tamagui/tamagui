description: How to set up Tamagui with Expo
---

<Notice>We're putting together a better guide soon!</Notice>

If you'd like to get a good idea of a set up with Expo, try out `npx create-tamagui-app@latest` which generates a managed expo project.

[The source for that is here](https://github.com/tamagui/starters).

Some notes:

Expo is on React 17 still. Make sure you de-dupe react so there's only one copy. With `yarn`, you'll set `resolutions` something like this:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "@types/react": "17.0.21",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
    "react-native-web": "^0.18"
  }
}
```

And you'll likely want the following dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-reanimated": "^2.8.0",
    "react-native-screens": "~3.11.1",
    "react-native-svg": "12.3.0",
    "react-native-web": "^0.18"
  }
}
```
