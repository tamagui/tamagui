description: How to set up Tamagui with Vite
---

Tamagui now has two plugins for Vite: one that sets up everything you need to get going, and a second that adds CSS compilation. Both are included in the `@tamagui/vite-plugin` package.

For a full-featured example, you can create a new app using `npm create tamagui@latest` and select the 'Simple Web' option which includes a Vite setup.

### Installation

1. Remove `"type": "module"` from your `package.json` if you have it. (The type module support was removed because it was breaking metro, webpack or something).
2. Add `@tamagui/vite-plugin`
3. And update your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { tamaguiExtractPlugin, tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tamaguiPlugin({
      config: './src/tamagui.config.ts',
      components: ['tamagui'],
    }),
    // optional, adds the optimizing compiler:
    tamaguiExtractPlugin(tamaguiConfig),
  ],
})
```

See the [Installation](/docs/intro/installation) and [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) docs for more on generally setting up Tamagui.
