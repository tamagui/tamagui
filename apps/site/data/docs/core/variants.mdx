description: Simple typed prop styles through styled()
---

Variants allow for a nice balance between simplicity and power, with affordances
for both the compiler and the type system.

In a style library you want to be able to succinctly add on conditional values
that expand into groups of styles. Variants do just that. Before explaining more
on why and how they work, an example:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(View, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

<Notice>
  Notice the `as const` on the variant definition object. This is necessary to
  please TypeScript until it gains the ability to infer constant objects. If
  left out, your types may break.
</Notice>

We can use this styled component like so:

```tsx
<Circle pin="top" centered size="$lg" />
```

This component uses a few different types of variants. Below we'll expand on
each.

But first, why variants?

## Why Variants?

You have two basic options for sharing styles across components: share style
objects and then combine them directly into your render function, or allow
abstraction in some form.

You can think of `StyleSheet.create` as "a lot of style objects". While this is
nice in that it's simple, it doesn't enforce any rules, which can get you in
trouble with both a compiler and a type system.

You end up basically typing props by hand and then doing somewhat arbitrary
logic to glue it all together inside a functional component. The types may not
map to the actual output, and a compiler will almost certainly get confused or
be unable to optimize with any easily unforeseen abstraction.

Variants force you out of the React render function, which means no hooks and a
much clearer contract of limitations: at most you take in a value, your design
system, and props, and you output a group of styles.

It's nice having this special area just for styling. It keeps your types correct
by definition. And it ensures the optimizing compiler can understand your styled
components and people on your team won't "de-opt" it on accident.

And because Variants work with the styled function, they nest without adding an
extra depth to your render tree. Doing `styled(styled())` results in a single
React component, and can be optimized and flattened by the compiler as well.
Whereas it's quite easy for developers to take an existing functional component
and throw in a new one around it, further de-optimizing a compiler and leading
to a less clear separation of styled components and regular ones.

## Variants

### Typed Variants

#### `true` or `false`

The special keys `true` and `false` will map to a boolean. So the `centered`
prop will be typed to accept true or false, and when true it will apply it's
styles.

```tsx
import { View, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const MyView = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    selectable: {
      true: {
        userSelect: 'auto',
      },
      false: {
        userSelect: 'none',
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

#### String, Boolean, Number Variants

You can use a pseudo Typescript syntax for other variants:

- `:string` - Accepts a `string`
- `:boolean` - Accepts a `boolean` (less precedence than `true` or `false`)
- `:number` - Accepts a `number`

```tsx
import { View, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const ColorfulView = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    color: {
      ':string': (color) => {
        // color is of type "string"
        return {
          color,
          borderColor: color,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

### Spread Variants

When you write variants, you have to be explicit so TypeScript and the runtime
know exactly which props you accept. This can be especially cumbersome when you
want to "gather" all the values of a specific token. For example, without spread
variants, if you wanted to have a `pad` property that accepted all the keys from
`tokens.size`, you'd have to write this:

```tsx
// in your tamagui.config.ts:
const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    sm: 10,
    md: 15,
    lg: 25,
    // ...
  }
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens
})

// somewhere in your app:
const MyButton = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    pad: {
      sm: {
        padding: tokens.size.sm,
      },
      md: {
        padding: tokens.size.md,
      },
      lg: {
        padding: tokens.size.lg,
      },
      // ...
    }
  } as const
})

// now you can
<MyButton pad="$lg" />
```

This is verbose, and only gets more verbose if you add more sizes. It would
require always updating every component every time you change the tokens.

Spread variants solve this problem. Instead, we can write:

```tsx
// in your tamagui.config.ts:
const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    sm: 10,
    md: 15,
    lg: 25,
    // ...
  }
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens
})

// somewhere in your app:
const MyButton = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    pad: {
      '...size': (val, { tokens }) => ({
        padding: tokens.size[val]
      }),
    }
  } as const
})

// now you can
<MyButton pad="$lg" />
```

Spread variants save you from having to define hardcoded styles for every key
(`sm`, `md`, `lg`) in your token object. They collect values from any of your
top level token categories. So you can only use `...color`, `...size`,
`...space`, `...font`, `...fontSize`, `...lineHeight`, `...radius`,
`...letterSpace`, or `...zIndex`. They must be prefixed with `...` as that is
how they are typed properly and assembled for runtime.

#### Extra properties passed to functional variants

There's a second argument passed to all variant functions that is a
bag-o-goodies that help you use the current tokens, theme, props, and fonts
easily.

```tsx
const SizableText = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens, font }) => {
        return {
          fontSize: font?.size,
          lineHeight: font?.lineHeight,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

Which you can use:

```tsx
<SizableText size="$md">Hello world</SizableText>
```

The Spread variant function will receive two arguments: the first is the value
given to the property (`"$lg"`), and the second is an object with
`{ theme, tokens, props, font }`.

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'theme',
      type: 'ThemeParsed',
      description: `A proxy to your theme that lets you access all theme values using normal keys, or with a "$" prefix.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'tokens',
      type: 'TokensParsed',
      description: `All your tokens given to createTamagui, ensuring the keys all start with "$".`,
    },
    {
      name: 'props',
      type: 'Props',
      description: `All props passed to the styled component.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'font',
      type: 'Font',
      description: `Maybe undefined. A single resolved Font that you passed to you fonts config.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'fontFamily',
      type: 'string',
      description: `Maybe undefined. The name of the current fontFamily.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'fonts',
      type: 'string',
      description: `All your fonts passed to createTamagui.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Catch-all variants

Much like a dynamic variant, except it lets you use it alongside the other typed
variants you need. Use '...' and it will grab all variants that don't match:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const ColorfulView = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    colorful: {
      true: {
        color: 'red',
      },
      '...': (val: string) => {
        // this will catch any other values that don't match
        return {
          color: val,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

#### Dynamic variants

If you need more complex types, or simply prefer a shorter syntax, you can use a
single function instead of using the object syntax for variants:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const MyView = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    doubleMargin: (val: number) => ({
      margin: val * 2,
    }),
  } as const,
})
```

Tamagui also provides a few types of other variant definition patterns that work
with tokens or types.

### defaultVariants

Sometimes you'd like to set a default value for a variant you've just set on
your styled() component. Due to the way Typescript types parse from left to
right, we can't properly type variants directly on the object you define them
on.

The `defaultVariants` option allows you to set these, properly typed:

```tsx
const Square = styled(View, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        // size === '$lg'
        // tokens.size.$lg === 25
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,

  // <Square /> will get size '$10' from size tokens automatically
  defaultVariants: {
    size: '$10',
  },
})
```

### Variants and Pseudos, Media Queries

Variants have the full power of the Tamagui styling system, including pseudo and
media styles:

```tsx
const SizedText = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      md: {
        fontSize: '$sm',

        $gtMd: {
          fontSize: '$md',
        },

        $gt2xl: {
          fontSize: '$lg',
        },
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

### Variants and Parent Variants

Styled components can access their parent components variants, even in their
variants:

```tsx
const ColorfulText = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    colored: {
      true: {
        color: '$color',
      },
    },

    large: {
      true: {
        fontSize: '$8',
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

const MyParagraph = styled(ColorfulText, {
  colored: true,

  variants: {
    hero: {
      true: {
        large: true,
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```
