description: Custom themes, tokens, shorthands, and media queries.
---

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` in the root of your app to set up your design system. It should only be imported by the top-level file that runs `React.render`, to ensure fast refresh works.

## Quick Start

You can use `@tamagui/config` which provides a complete config out of the box, the same one this site uses.

```tsx
// the v2 config imports the css driver on web and react-native on native
// for reanimated: @tamagui/config/v2-reanimated
// for react-native only: @tamagui/config/v2-native
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v2'
import { Text, View } from 'react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const appConfig = createTamagui(config)

export type AppConfig = typeof appConfig

declare module 'tamagui' {
  // or '@tamagui/core'
  // overrides TamaguiCustomConfig so your custom types
  // work everywhere you import `tamagui`
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default appConfig
```

[The source](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/config/src/config.ts) and [type output](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/config/types/config.d.ts) of that config is also useful as a reference for building your own custom config.

---

Another quick start that gives a bit more customization is using `@tamagui/shorthands` for our preset shorthands, and `@tamagui/themes` for the same themes and tokens used for this site. Then you'll just want to bring along any fonts, media queries, and animations you need.

```tsx
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const appConfig = createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
})

export type AppConfig = typeof appConfig

declare module '@tamagui/core' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default appConfig
```

Depending on if you're using just `@tamagui/core`, `tamagui`, or your own custom design library, be sure the import of `createTamagui` and `declare module` type matches to the one you're using.

### Customizing themes

A lot of people want to use the Tamagui themes as the base, but then customize specific pieces. For this, we recommend literally installing `@tamagui/create-theme` and then [copy-pasting the source of `@tamagui/themes` somewhere near your tamagui.config.ts](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/themes/src/themes.tsx).

The file uses our `create-theme` package which isn't documented yet but has somewhat simple source you can check out and it gives you a really complete example of building out a suite of themes, sub-themes, and component themes that you can fork or change to your taste.

<Notice>
  We highly recommend you don't get bogged down in customizing themes too early. It's
  better to get used to Tamagui with the quick start, get a feel for how themes work, and
  then go in and customize.
</Notice>

## Overview

Let's start with an example of a complete `tamagui.config.ts` which is in the code block below. Note that keys used here can be customized to your liking, but using them in combination with [shorthands](#shorthands) give you a nice syntax like this:

```tsx
<XStack bg="$red" w="$2" h="$1" />
```

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'
import { createFont, createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  // keys used for the objects you pass to `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight`
  // and `letterSpacing` should be consistent. The `createFont` function
  // will fill-in any missing values if `lineHeight`, `weight` or `letterSpacing`
  // are subsets of `size`
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
  },
  lineHeight: {
    // 1 will be 22
    2: 22,
  },
  weight: {
    1: '300',
    // 2 will be 300
    3: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    1: 0,
    2: -1,
    // 3 will be -1
  },
  // (native) swap out fonts by face/style
  face: {
    300: { normal: 'InterLight', italic: 'InterItalic' },
    600: { normal: 'InterBold' },
  },
})

// these keys can be different, but again we highly recommend consistency
const size = {
  0: 0,
  1: 5,
  2: 10,
  // ....
}

export const tokens = createTokens({
  size,
  space: { ...size, '-1': -5, '-2': -10 },
  radius: { 0: 0, 1: 3 },
  zIndex: { 0: 0, 1: 100, 2: 200 },
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})

const config = createTamagui({
  fonts: {
    // for tamagui, heading and body are assumed
    heading: interFont,
    body: interFont,
  },
  tokens,
  themes: {
    light: {
      bg: '#f2f2f2',
      color: tokens.color.black,
    },
    dark: {
      bg: '#111',
      color: tokens.color.white,
    },
  },

  // `@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media query capabilities out of the box
  // for native as it is de-coupled from react-native.

  // For web-only, media queries work out of the box and you can avoid the
  // `createMedia` call here by passing the media object directly.

  // If targeting React Native, add this driver and use this `createMedia` helper.
  // If web-only you can leave out `createMedia` and just use an object.
  media: createMedia({
    sm: { maxWidth: 860 },
    gtSm: { minWidth: 860 + 1 },
    short: { maxHeight: 820 },
    hoverNone: { hover: 'none' },
    pointerCoarse: { pointer: 'coarse' },
  }),

  // optional:

  // add custom shorthand props
  // note: as const is important, without it you may see breaking types
  shorthands: {
    px: 'paddingHorizontal',
    f: 'flex',
    w: 'width',
  } as const,

  // Experimental / advanced, only for overriding the core component styles
  // Prefer to use styled() for building your own, only useful for edge cases.
  defaultProps: {
    Text: {
      // override any default props here
    },
  },
})

type AppConfig = typeof config

// this will give you types for your components
// note - if using your own design system, put the package name here instead of tamagui
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // if you want types for group styling props, define them like so:
  interface TypeOverride {
    groupNames(): 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
  }
}

export default config
```

The `createTamagui` function receives a configuration object:

- `tokens`: Use `createTokens` to generate variables in your theme and app.
- `theme`: Define your design [theme](/docs/intro/themes), which map to CSS properties.
- `media`: Define reusable responsive [media queries](/docs/use-media).
- `shorthands`: Define any props you want to expand to style values, keys being the shorthand and values being the expanded style prop.
- `defaultProps`: For more advanced uses, you can override all named `styled()` components initial values. These merge downwards, so `styled(Text, { name: 'Paragraph' })` will get any defaultProps set for `Text`.
- `onlyAllowShorthands` when set to true will ensure that if you define shorthands, they override existing long-form style props.

<Notice>
  On Android you need to set the `face` option in `createFont` or else fonts wont pick up
  different weights, due to a React Native restriction.
</Notice>

Note, for `tamagui` (not core), it expects you to define a `true` token that maps to your default size, this way it knows what token to use by default. So you'd do something like this:

```tsx
export const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    small: 20,
    medium: 30,
    true: 30, // note true = 30 just like medium, your default size token
    large: 40,
  },
  space: {
    small: 10,
    medium: 20,
    true: 20, // same goes for space and other token categories
    large: 30,
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  The compiler will parse your tamagui.config.ts file at build-time. For this reason, we
  recommend keeping it relatively simple. Don't import heavy dependencies, and prefer to
  import `createTamagui` and other helpers directly from @tamagui/core.
</Notice>

### Add Provider

Import and use the Tamagui `Provider` component at the top component in your app.

```tsx line=3-5
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      <AppContents />
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Using Tamagui Provider

TamaguiProvider takes a few optional properties:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'defaultTheme',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      description: `The initial top level theme.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'disableRootThemeClass',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'Disable inserting a theme class in the DOM or context, allowing you to manually place it higher. For custom use cases like integration with next-theme.',
    },
    {
      name: 'disableInjectCSS',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: `By default Tamagui inserts CSS with a useLayoutEffect on load. But if you're setting up SSR you'll want to use getCSS() on the server instead and then turn on this setting.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

If you use `disableInjectCSS`, you'll need to use this somewhere to insert your CSS into head:

### Including the reset css

There is an optional CSS reset that helps normalize styling, you can import it into your app like so:

```tsx
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'
```

<Notice>
  You will have to turn `isCSSEnabled` on if you're using Metro as your web bundler. See
  [Expo's docs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/metro/#css).
</Notice>

### Setup media query driver

`@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media capabilities out of the box to native apps, while on the web it uses native media queries. To enable media queries for React Native, you need to provide matchMedia implementation:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/react-native-media-driver
```

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'

export default createTamagui({
  media: createMedia({
    xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
    // ...
  }),
})
```

##### Optimizing further (Advanced)

```tsx
import Tamagui from './tamagui.config'

const css = Tamagui.getCSS()
// insert into your head
```

Note that you can optimize this a bit by generating your CSS at build-time and then avoiding generating it on the client. This is covered in the Next.js Guide as it gives a good example of how to put all the pieces together properly, but you can apply it to any other framework.

To do this you would do something like this:

```tsx
Tamagui.getCSS({
  // if you are calling getCSS on the server somewhere, you can add this { exclude: 'design-system' }
  // to your *client* side getCSS call to avoid more work and duplicate CSS generation.

  // Note that you call getCSS on both the server and client. This is what you'd write on the client.
  // It will ensure any CSS generated by your first render pass is available.
  exclude: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'design-system' : null,
})
```

For Next.js there's a nice [option to `outputCSS`](/docs/guides/next-js) which will handle emitting a css file for you. But you can also just do this yourself by calling Tamagui.getCSS() with any other bundler or framework sometime in your pre-build or on the server and handing it over as CSS.

One final optimization you can make if you are doing these server-side CSS patterns is setting the environment variable `TAMAGUI_DOES_SSR_CSS` to `"true"` for the client bundle only. One gotcha - if you plan on calling `mutateTheme` or `addTheme` at some point, set `TAMAGUI_DOES_SSR_CSS` to `"mutates-themes"`. This will still give you the benefits of reduced bundle size, but avoids removing the entirety of the theme generation JS so it can mutate themes at runtime.

Most bundlers will then be able to shake out all the theme-related CSS generation code from `@tamagui/core`, saving ~2kb of minified JS. If you set `outputCSS` option with Next.js, this will be set automatically.

<Notice>
  Make sure the style tag you insert with the `getCSS` styles is inserted after any
  `react-native-web` style tags to ensure Tamagui overrides those styles.
</Notice>

## Tokens

Tokens have a structure inspired by but divergent from the [Theme UI spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/). They are mapped to CSS variables at build time.

### Font tokens

The font tokens are a bit special and are created with `createFont`:

```tsx
const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
    // ...
  },
  lineHeight: {
    1: 17,
    2: 22,
    3: 25,
    // ...
  },
  weight: {
    4: '300',
    6: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    4: 0,
    8: -1,
  },

  // for native only, alternate family based on weight/style
  face: {
    // pass in weights as keys
    700: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    800: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    900: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  Note, you don't need to use numbered keys, you can use `sm` or `tiny` or whatever you'd
  like. But you do want keep those keys consistent.
</Notice>

This gives you a lot of power over customizing every aspect of your design based on each font family. In other styling libraries that follow the Theme UI spec, you generally don't group your size/lineHeight/weight/etc tokens by the family, which means you are forced to choose a single vertical rhythm no matter the font.

Things to note:

- The keys of `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight`, and `letterSpacing` are meant to match.
- Define the full set of keys on `size`, the rest can be a subset.
- Missing keys from partially defined objects will be filled in.
  - In the example above, `weight` is only defined at `4` and `6`.
  - At creation Tamagui fills in the missing keys with previous value, or the next one if no previous exists. So weight `1` === `300`, weight `5` === `300`, and weight `7` === `600`.

#### Custom Font Family on Native

You need to load your fonts for React Native to recognize them. Typically this looks something like if using Expo, (or you can [follow a React Native guide here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35255645/how-to-set-default-font-family-in-react-native)):

```tsx
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'

function App() {
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    Inter: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Medium.otf"),
    InterBold: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Bold.otf"),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded) {
      // can hide splash screen here
    }
  }, [loaded])

  if (!loaded) {
    return null;
  }

  return <MyApp />
}
```

---

### Non-font tokens

The rest of the tokens categories besides font are flatter. The `space` and `size` generally share keys, and that space can generally use negative keys as well.

```tsx
// passed into createTamagui
const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})
```

You access tokens then by using `$` prefixes in your values. Tamagui knows which tokens to use based on the style property you use.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <Text fontSize="$lg" lineHeight="$lg" fontFamily="$mono" color="$white">
    Hello world
  </Text>
)
```

One final note: using tokens with themes. Tokens are considered a "fallback" to themes, so any values you define in your theme will override the token. The next section will explain this further.

### Configuring tokens

There are a few settings that control how strict your style values are allowed to be, which are handled by the `settings` option of `createTamagui`. See the [type strictness settings](#settings) below.

### Themes

Themes live one level below tokens. Tokens are your variables, where themes use those tokens to create consistent, generic properties that you then typically use in shareable components. Themes should generally only deal with colors.

Tamagui components in general expect a set of theme keys to be defined like the following, but you can deviate if you create your own design system.

```tsx
const light = {
  background: '#fff',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray2,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray4,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray5,
  backgroundTransparent: tokens.color.grayA1,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray4,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray6,
  borderColorPress: tokens.color.gray12,
  borderColorFocus: tokens.color.gray11,
  color: tokens.color.gray10,
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray9,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray8,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray8,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA4,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA6,
  shadowColorPress: tokens.color.grayA8,
  shadowColorFocus: tokens.color.grayA8,
  ...lightColors,
}
```

You don't have to use tokens as your theme values, but if you do they avoid some overhead. With Tamagui, the idea is that `bg`, `color`, and `borderColor` represent the "primary" and clearest colors, and `bg2`, `color2` etc get more subtle.

To see how it works, here's a snippet from `InteractiveFrame` which is the frame component that's used in `Button`:

```tsx
export const InteractiveFrame = styled(XStack, {
  borderRadius: '$1',
  paddingVertical: '$2',
  paddingHorizontal: '$3',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  cursor: 'pointer',
  flexWrap: 'nowrap',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  flexShrink: 1,

  hoverStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover',
  },

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundPress',
  },

  // ...
})
```

### Media

For more full docs on media queries, see the [useMedia docs page](/docs/core/use-media).

### Animations

Choose one of `@tamagui/animations-css`, `@tamagui/animations-react-native` or `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`. Note that `reanimated` support is not as well supported.

Append a new key `animations` to your `createTamagui` call:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'

// pass this exported `animations` to your `createTamagui` call:
export const animations = createAnimations({
    bouncy: {
      damping: 9,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 150,
    },
    lazy: {
      damping: 18,
      stiffness: 50,
    },
  }),
})
```

If you want to have different drivers for each platform, like a CSS driver for the web and react-native for native, simply use the React Native convention of having platform-specific files: add a `animations.ts` and `animations.native.ts`. Set them up just like above, with matching keys, but importing from their respective driver.

### Shorthands

Shorthands are defined directly on your `createTamagui` call, rather than being attached to each component, to de-couple shorthands from components. This forces component kits to standardize on the basic react-native style syntax and ensures there's only one set of abbreviations defined ever.

Here's an example of a partial shorthands configuration:

```tsx
// the as const ensures types work with the optional `onlyAllowShorthands` option
const shorthands = {
  ac: 'alignContent',
  ai: 'alignItems',
  als: 'alignSelf',
  bblr: 'borderBottomLeftRadius',
  bbrr: 'borderBottomRightRadius',
  bc: 'backgroundColor',
  br: 'borderRadius',
  btlr: 'borderTopLeftRadius',
  btrr: 'borderTopRightRadius',
  f: 'flex',
  // ...
} as const

export default createTamagui({
  shorthands,
})
```

For a full configuration, see [@tamagui/shorthands](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/shorthands/src/index.tsx)

#### Type strictness

_AllowedStyleValuesSetting_:

Defaults to false:

- "strict" - only allows tokens for any token-enabled properties
- "strict-web" - same as strict but allows for web-specific tokens like auto/inherit
- "somewhat-strict" - allow tokens or:
  - for space/size: string% or numbers
  - for radius: number
  - for zIndex: number
  - for color: named colors or rgba/hsla strings
- "somewhat-strict-web" - same as somewhat-strict but allows for web-specific tokens
- false (default) - allows any string (or number for styles that accept numbers)

```tsx
type AllowedValueSetting =
  | boolean
  | 'strict'
  | 'somewhat-strict'
  | 'strict-web'
  | 'somewhat-strict-web'

type AllowedStyleValuesSetting =
  | AllowedValueSetting
  | {
      space?: AllowedValueSetting
      size?: AllowedValueSetting
      radius?: AllowedValueSetting
      zIndex?: AllowedValueSetting
      color?: AllowedValueSetting
    }

_autocompleteSpecificTokens_:

The VSCode autocomplete puts specific tokens above the regular ones, which leads to worse DX.
If true this setting removes the specific token from types for the defined categories.

If set to "except-special", specific tokens will autocomplete only if they don't normally use
one of the special token groups: space, size, radius, zIndex, color.
