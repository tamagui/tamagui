title: Stack & Text
description: The base views of @tamagui/core.
---

Stack and Text are functionally equivalent to React Native `View` and `Text`, they just accept the superset of props that Tamagui supports.

Beyond View, Stack sets `flexDirection` to `column`.

### Props

See [the Props docs](/docs/styling/props) for the full list of properties.

### Usage

You can use them directly:

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Stack margin={10}>
    <Text color="$color">Hello</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

We encourage you to use inline styles. Combined with [shorthands](/docs/core/configuration#shorthands) they can lead to really easy styling, and the Tamagui optimizing compiler will take care of optimizing everything for you so that there is little to no extra cost in performance:

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Stack mx="$sm" scale={1.2}>
    <Text c="$color">Hello</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

<Notice>
  One really important and useful thing to note about Tamagui style properties: the order
  is important! [Read more here](/docs/styling/styled#order-is-important)
</Notice>

### With styled()

You can also use them [with styled](/docs/styling/styled) to create your own lower level views that are meant to be re-usable:

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

Inline styles and `styled()` both are optimized by the compiler, so you can author styles using both depending on the use case.

### Only for web

When set a `defaultFont` is defined in your `tamagui.config.ts` and it's set to be one of key values found in the correct part of the design system, you basically d

### View

As of version `1.31` Tamagui exports a `View` as well, which has no style properties set by default (as opposed to Stack which sets the flexDirection to column by default).
