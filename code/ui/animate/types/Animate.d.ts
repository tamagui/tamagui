* Because mounting and unmounting children can be expensive, this gives us the
* option to avoid that.
*
* type: 'presence' will act just like AnimatePresence, except you use `present`
* instead of conditional children.
* Note that this does avoid reconciling the children even when present={false}
* so no extra cost to perf over AnimatePresence.
*
* type: 'presence' with keepChildrenMounted true *always* render the children so you pay
* the cost up-front to mount them, but then you avoid the mount cost at the start
* of the animation.
*
* There's no "right way" it just depends on the use case, this component just makes
* it easier to choose the strategy yourself.
