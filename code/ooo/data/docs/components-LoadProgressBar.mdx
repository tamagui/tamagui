Render this component to show a loading progress bar at the top of the browser frame while pages are loading. This is a web-only component and should be rendered in your root `_layout.tsx` file.

```tsx
import { LoadProgressBar, Slot } from 'one'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <>
      <LoadProgressBar />
      <Slot />
    </>
  )
}
```

export type LoadProgressBarProps = {
  /** How long after a navigation to wait before showing the progress bar (in ms) */
  startDelay?: number
  /** How long after a navigation completes to wait before hiding the progress bar (in ms) */
