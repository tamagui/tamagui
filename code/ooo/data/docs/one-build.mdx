title: one build
---

Building your app for production happens through `one build`.

It takes the first argument as the platform, which defaults to `web`.

```bash
npx one build [web | ios | android]
```

To build for iOS for example, you would run:

```bash
npx one build ios
```

## Building for web

Ensure your `.env` file has a `ONE_SERVER_URL` set to your production URL, like:

```
ONE_SERVER_URL=https://onestack.dev
```

You can choose a deploy target, for now we only support `node` or `vercel`. This can be chosen via your Vite configuration:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      web: {
        deploy: 'vercel' // defaults to node
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

And the CLI will print instructions on how to deploy when you run `npx one build`.

You can also choose the platform when you run serve, after the build is complete:

```bash
npx one serve --platform vercel
```

## Building for native

We don't have an end-to-end build command yet, but One is designed to be easy to integrate into existing Expo or React Native build processes.

If you're familiar with EAS, see how to [Build and Deliver Native Apps with EAS](/docs/guides-eas).

Or check out the [iOS Native Guide](/docs/guides-ios-native) for instructions on building your iOS app with Xcode.
