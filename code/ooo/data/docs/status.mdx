title: Status
description: One is currently in beta
---

This is a live document covering the high level status of the various parts of One. We don't cover all areas, just high level stable, and all developing or unstable sub-areas.

Broadly: web is generally stable, native is a bit further behind but is able to be daily driven in dev mode. We need to test and improve support of a wider variety of node_modules, and add documentation and tests.
