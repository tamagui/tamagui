i wanted you to actually redo the entire driver or at least fix it not just fuss around doing nothing, this isnt simple work it may take a whole year of effort to granularly validate its behavior across many scnarios and animations, dont just plan TEST, IN REAL BROWSER, IWTH PLAYWRIGHT and log the ENTIRE animation progress on every frame and analyze dumps like that across at least 30 different scnearios
