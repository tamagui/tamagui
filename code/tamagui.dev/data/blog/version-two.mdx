<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui v2 realizes the vision we set out to achieve in the beginning: a suite
  of native and web style primitives and UI components that don't sacrifice
  performance, accessibility, and control for any platform.
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui goes deeper than any other style library at achieving high performance
  across every platform - at every level: runtime, compile-time, and careful
  design to support advanced techinques like server-side rendering, and advanced
  styling like container queries.
</IntroParagraph>

Thanks to it's unique ability to support all features at both runtime and
compile-time, plus its optimizing compiler, Tamagui lets you ship world class
experiences without being forced into writing every single piece of UI twice.

Tamagui is used by companies large and small, with hundreds of millions of users
a month. We took the slow approach with version 2 as we've spent the last two
years closing issues, optimizing performance, refactoring internals, and adding
tests.

Tamagui has grown in many ways since version 1:

- Added hundreds of tests, stricter lints, dependency checks and a stricter
  release process to improve stability.
- Created `@tamagui/build`, the only way to publish npm packages that support
  both CommonJS and ESModules, on both native and web, without any configuration
  at all no matter what bundler you use.
- Added many richer styling features like container queries, container and media
  queries combined, and platform/theme selectors.
- Added compound components like Tabs, Accordion, and ToggleGroup.
- Added unstyled versions of every component.
- Improved theme generation packages, and released a free visual Theme builder.
- The Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.
- We worked hard to improve documentation, a process that's taken much work.

Version 2 has only minor many breaking changes. It mostly removes deprecated
APIs that were holding us back from some more ambitious projects we want to take
on going forward, as well as adding a few new or refactored components.

The breaking changes outside of deprecations are:

- Default flex behavior now aligns with React Native (can opt-out).
- Button and ListItem are re-written to be slightly simplified and much faster.
- Removed deprecated `space` and `spaceDirection` props in favor of gap.
- Moved the `<Spacer />` component from core into `@tamagui/spacer`.
- Moved all settings on `createTamagui` onto the `settings` object.

### Improving

Tamagui has been far from perfect. Our team at times over-prioritized release
cadence, refactors, performance re-writes, and ambitious "meta" like redoing our
build system (to support less configuration, or ESM, or new bundlers).

We know from feedback that this left a sour taste to many, especially those who
upgaded often and found issues as they did. Tamagui is massive - about 200
packages, and supports an incredible amount of use cases - 4 runtimes, 3
platforms, server and web, many screen sizes, and an ecosystem (React Native)
that is moving fast.

We pushed releasing version 2 back an entire year as we decided January of this
year that we weren't going to release the next major until we felt we'd not only
signficantly improved our stability, but also generally addressed all major
outstanding issues (and a lot of minor ones).

I'm proud of how this year has gone. Our efforts improving testing, a slowed
release cadence, and honestly just the general maturity of our massive repo has
helped us get to a place that feels good.

That said, I want to personally apologize to our community. Tamagui started as a
personal project that found pretty great success. It was a hard transition for
me from personal project into OSS success.

I've learned about what it means to run a large, highly depended-on project in
the last years. I'm humbled by the ongoing support, and feel motivated to prove
to the world that we've learned many valuable lessons in open source.

### What's next

todo

#### More major versions

We're not going to wait two years to release 3.0. Instead, we'll be aiming for a
major release at least twice a year. There are quite a few obvious wins we can
already see that we will be deprecating shortly. We especially can reduce the
core size and land major features more quickly if we do this, so we will be.

#### Aligment with the web

Much like React Native itself, Tamagui will aggressively be moving it's styling
syntax to align with the web. In the next major versions we will make breaking
changes (with codemods to help migration) that will do as much.

React Native plans to move to React Strict DOM, which basically brings many
props in line with web standards. Tamagui should work with React Strict DOM
already, but we will also be ensuring Tamagui core itself also makes these same
changes.

#### A more flexible core

Tamagui is pretty opionionated today with how it handles your design system. But
it doesn't fit everyones use cases. We're working to make the core of Tamagui
completely customizable, so that you can BYO setup, and still have it optimize.

Tamagui really is just an extremely well-developed styling engine that has many
hard-fought features to make it performant and platform-native across web and
native. No other style library really matches our breadth of features \*
optimization, and we'd like to make Tamagui able to support many other types of
style syntaxes. That could be just your own custom view components, or even
something like a Tailwind-like syntax.

#### Native components

The ultimate UI for most iOS and Android apps should use lots of native
components. We've already done this with our `<Sheet native />` integration with
`react-native-ios-modal`, which brings incredible-feeling iOS native sheets to
your React Native apps. We're going to continue working towards making a full
suite of native components.
