<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui is a comprehensive solution to cross-platform UI on React and React
  Native with an unmatched combination of performance, features, type-safety,
  and depth.
</IntroParagraph>

Tamagui's strength lies in its maturity and depth: at about 200 packages, it
covers everything: performant and feature-rich styling, a large suite of
headless and composable UI components, powerful design system and theme
generation, a rich copy-paste component suite, and a ton of first-class starter
kits.

The core style library is the star: no other system brings as many style
features from CSS to native, and yet it also:

- Supports all features across native and web.
- Supports all features server-side and client-side.
- Supports all features at both runtime and compile-time.
- Requires zero bundler setup on any platform.

The result of this is your team can count on Tamagui to just work, work fast,
and be easy to adapt to any use case on web and native.

In comparison to other solutions, Tamagui is especially strong at:

- _Able to share 100% between web and native._ Many other solutions focus on one
  platform more than others, or implement their features in sub-par ways on web.
- _Great performance and platform feeling on both web and native._ As a small
  example - you can choose from 4 [animation drivers](/docs/2.0/core/animations) (CSS, Reanimated, Motion,
  React Native), per-platform, yet no matter which you choose proper SSR with
  [media queries](/docs/2.0/core/use-media) and dark mode properly renders and hydrates.
- _Fast, type-safe, properly mergeable inline styling._ Inline styles are a leap
  forward, but the lack of type safety or easy ability to merge and group your
  styles is their biggest drawback. Tamagui is fully type safe, lets you
  perfectly control how you merge styles per-component, optimizing it all nearly
  perfectly even in the face of complicated logic.
- _Inline styles, shared styles that are fast_: The optimizing compiler outputs
  perfect platform-specific code, even with logic-filled inline styles. That
  means your team can write intuitive, easy to maintain, typed styles that merge
  perfectly down the tree without worrying about the typical performance
  penalty.
- _A first-class, composable components based UI kit._ Our UI kit is great at
  both native and web, has a first-class composable component API, and can
  easily adapt from one type of component to another based on the device or
  media query.
- _Zero configuration._ We invested heavily into a custom build pipeline that
  outputs entirely separate files for native and web, with each having multiple
  custom transforms such that **Tamagui doesn't need any setup at all, on any
  platform**. No bundler plugin, no babel transform, no matter if it's Vite,
  Metro, Webpack, Turbopack, you name it.

We're proud to be used by companies like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), who
leveraged Tamagui to unify their feature set across platforms and greatly
simplify their codebase.

## Improvements during Version 1

Tamagui improved continuously:

- Over 500 new tests, stricter lints, dependency checks and a stricter release
  process to improve stability.
- Refined
  [`@tamagui/build`](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/v2/code/packages/build/README.md),
  the only way to publish npm packages that support both CommonJS and ESModules
  as well as native and web, all without requiring any configuration at all for
  end users.
- Added many styling features like [container queries](/docs/2.0/core/use-media#container-queries), container and media
  queries combined, and platform/theme selectors.
- New compound components like [Tabs](/docs/2.0/components/tabs), [Accordion](/docs/2.0/components/accordion), and [ToggleGroup](/docs/2.0/components/toggle-group).
- [Unstyled](/docs/2.0/guides/unstyled) versions of every component.
- Improved [theme generation](/docs/2.0/core/themes) packages, and released a free visual Theme builder.
- The Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.
- Greatly improved documentation, especially in the last year.
- In-place optimization via CLI, so no need for specific bundler integration.

### Breaking Changes

The breaking changes outside of deprecations are:

- **`animation` prop renamed to `transition`** to align with web:

```tsx
// Before
<View animation="bouncy" />
<View animation={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />

// After
<View transition="bouncy" />
<View transition={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

Similarly, `animateOnly` is now `transitionOnly`, and `animatePresence` is now
`transitionPresence`.

- Default `position` changed from `relative` to `static` to align with CSS
  defaults. Use `settings.defaultPosition: 'relative'` to restore old behavior.
- Default `flexBasis` changed from `auto` to `0` for flex items. Use
  `settings.styleCompat: 'legacy'` to restore old behavior.
- [Button](/docs/2.0/components/button) and [ListItem](/docs/2.0/components/list-item) use composition pattern instead of direct text/icon props.
- [`useTheme()`](/docs/2.0/core/use-theme) no longer accepts props - use [`<Theme>`](/docs/2.0/core/themes) component instead.
- Removed `themeInverse` prop and `<Theme inverse>` - use explicit theme names.
- Removed `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` - use `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`.
- Removed `createTheme` export - just use plain objects.
- Removed `setupReactNative` - auto-detection now handles this.
- Added 30+ web event handlers (keyboard, pointer, drag/drop, clipboard,
  scroll).
- Moved from ThemeableStack to View for most UI component bases.

### Deprecations Removed

Things deprecated in version one that are now gone:

- `space`, `spaceDirection`, and `separator` props - use [`gap`](/docs/2.0/core/stack-and-text) instead.
- [`<Spacer />`](/docs/2.0/components/spacer) moved from core to `@tamagui/spacer`.
- `themeClassNameOnRoot` replaced with [`settings.addThemeClassName`](/docs/2.0/core/configuration).
- `extractable()` method - use [`styleable()`](/docs/2.0/core/styled) instead.
- `selectable` prop on Text - use `userSelect` instead.
- `ellipse` prop on SizableText - renamed to `ellipsis`.
- `textAlignVertical` - use `verticalAlign` instead.
- `focusable` prop - use `tabIndex={0}` instead.
- `dataSet` prop - use `data-*` attributes directly.
- All root-level [`createTamagui`](/docs/2.0/core/configuration) settings moved to `settings` object.

## Changes

Version 2 aligns to the web, supports new style props, adds a few small style
features, refines the default configuration, and adds two new Menu components.
It's not a hard upgrade, most of the breaking changes have been deprecated for a
long time.

### Config v5

Our recommended default config, Config v4, evolves into a more mature setup with
v5. The good news is that v5 is very iterative and easy to move to.

What v5 does add makes styling a lot easier - many more opacity values, shadow
values, a bit more refined colors, and much easier customization of sub-themes.

The new [`createV5Theme()`](/docs/2.0/core/themes) factory makes for easier custom theme creation:

```tsx
import { createV5Theme } from '@tamagui/themes/v5'

const customThemes = createV5Theme({
  colors: {
    brand: { light: [...], dark: [...] }
  }
})
```

The v5 theme system also by default adds `alt1`, `alt2`, `surface1`, `surface2`,
`surface3`, and `accent` variants for all color themes.

### REM Units on Native

You can now use rem units in your styles on native platforms:

```tsx
<View padding="1.5rem" fontSize="1rem" />
```

Rem values are calculated using `PixelRatio.getFontScale()`, so they
automatically respect the user's accessibility font size settings. Configure the
base size with `settings.remBaseFontSize` (defaults to 16).

### Motion Animation Driver

We've added a new [animation driver](/docs/2.0/core/animations) powered by [Motion](https://motion.dev), and
it's our recommended choice for web. The `@tamagui/animations-motion` package
brings excellent performance through some key architectural decisions.

The Motion driver avoids React re-renders entirely during animations. When
styles change, instead of triggering a re-render cycle, it directly mutates the
DOM through Motion's `useAnimate` hook. This is enabled by setting
`avoidReRenders: true` internally, which tells Tamagui's core to emit style
changes via a callback rather than through state updates.

Under the hood, Motion leverages the
[Web Animations API (WAAPI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API),
which runs animations off the main thread. This means your spring animations run
at 60fps even when JavaScript is busy. The driver also implements intelligent
diffing - it tracks the previous animated styles and only sends changed
properties to Motion, minimizing work on each frame.

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'

const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
  lazy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    stiffness: 60,
  },
})
```

The result is buttery smooth animations that don't block your UI, making it
ideal for complex interactive components like sheets, popovers, and page
transitions on web.

### Transition Delay

All animation drivers now support delays:

```tsx
<View transition={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

This works with CSS, React Native Animated, Reanimated, and Motion drivers.

### Popover Transform Origin

[Popover](/docs/2.0/components/popover) and [Tooltip](/docs/2.0/components/tooltip) now automatically calculate the correct CSS
`transform-origin` based on placement and arrow position. This means scale
animations naturally "grow" from the anchor point where the content connects to
the trigger.

```tsx
<Popover placement="bottom">
  <Popover.Trigger asChild>
    <Button>Open</Button>
  </Popover.Trigger>
  <Popover.Content
    transition="quick"
    enterStyle={{ scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 }}
    exitStyle={{ scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 }}
  >
    {/* Content scales from top center, near the trigger */}
    <Popover.Arrow />
    {/* ... */}
  </Popover.Content>
</Popover>
```

The transform origin adjusts automatically based on the final placement - if the
popover flips from `bottom` to `top`, the origin updates accordingly. This
creates polished, native-feeling animations without any manual configuration.

### Web-aligned Image and Input Components

[Input](/docs/2.0/components/input) and [Image](/docs/2.0/components/image) now follow web-aligned APIs, with some old props supported but
deprecated.

The v1 versions of both components are still available via:

```tsx
import { Input } from '@tamagui/input/v1'
import { Image } from '@tamagui/image/v1'
import { Input, Image } from 'tamagui/v1'
```

### Button and List Component Simplification

[Button](/docs/2.0/components/button) and [ListItem](/docs/2.0/components/list-item) remove direct text style props on the outer frame, and now only
support composition for better performance and flexibility:

```tsx
<Button>
  <Button.Icon icon={Plus} />
  <Button.Text>Add Item</Button.Text>
</Button>
```

This replaces the old approach of passing `icon` and text style props directly,
though you can still use the simple `<Button>Hello</Button>` pattern for simple
cases.

### @tamagui/react-native-web-lite

React Native Web has slowed down development quite dramatically, and has a
variety of issues when used on the web or in modern JS projects. We built this
package by translating `react-native-web` first to TypeScript, then moving to a
modern esmodule setup, and finally enabling tree shaking. It's not perfectly
compatible with `react-native-web`, it strips out the style system to share a
bit of Tamagui internals, and so breaks one thing at least -
`pointer-events: box-none`, for now. But for the most part, if you're using
Tamagui for most styling, you can save a huge amount of bundled JS on the web by
aliasing to this package.

### Headless and Unstyled Components

During v2 we're expanding headless components. Many components now have three
variants:

- **Styled** - Full Tamagui components with default styles
- **Unstyled** - Uses a `createX` factory allowing fully custom styling
- **Headless** - Zero dependency on `@tamagui/core`, just hooks

The headless packages (`@tamagui/switch-headless`, `@tamagui/checkbox-headless`,
`@tamagui/radio-headless`, `@tamagui/tabs-headless`) provide hooks like
[`useSwitch`](/docs/2.0/components/switch), [`useCheckbox`](/docs/2.0/components/checkbox), [`useRadioGroup`](/docs/2.0/components/radio-group), and [`useTabs`](/docs/2.0/components/tabs) that handle all the
state management, accessibility, and keyboard navigation - letting you bring
your own styling solution.

This makes Tamagui components usable even if you're not using Tamagui for
styling. For now it's a subset, but we plan to continue expanding headless
exports throughout v2.

### Other Minor Improvements

- **Insets support**: Pass `insets` to [`TamaguiProvider`](/docs/2.0/core/configuration) for safe area handling.
- **FocusGuard**: New [`@tamagui/focus-guard`](/docs/2.0/components/focus-guard) package for focus trapping.
- **Component classes**: All components now output `is_ComponentName` classes
  for easier debugging and CSS targeting.

### New Components

We've added two new menu components that automatically adapt to each platform:

#### Menu

[Menu](/docs/2.0/components/menu) provides dropdown menus with full keyboard
navigation, submenus, checkbox items, and animations. On iOS and Android, it
automatically renders using native platform menus.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <MenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Menu

```

#### ContextMenu

[ContextMenu](/docs/2.0/components/context-menu) works like Menu but activates on
right-click (web) or long-press (native). It includes support for preview
content on iOS.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ContextMenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>
```tsx hero template=ContextMenu

```

### Matured Components

Several components that were in beta during v1 are now fully stable and
production-ready:

#### Tabs

[Tabs](/docs/2.0/components/tabs) provides keyboard-navigable tabbed interfaces with
smooth animations and full accessibility support.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TabsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tabs

```

#### Accordion

[Accordion](/docs/2.0/components/accordion) provides collapsible content sections
with customizable animations and single or multiple expansion modes.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <AccordionDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Accordion

```

#### Tooltip

[Tooltip](/docs/2.0/components/tooltip) now uses floating positioning for smarter
placement that automatically adjusts to viewport boundaries.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TooltipDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tooltip

```

#### Image

[Image](/docs/2.0/components/image) provides cross-platform image handling with
consistent APIs across web and native.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ImageDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Image

```

## Goals

Our main goal with version two is **stability**. Tamagui started as a side
project with incredible scope and maintained an ambitious stance towards landing
large features and internal improvements, but that led to too many regressions
during version one. I'd like to personally apologize for that.

For v2, we want to ensure that won't happen anymore. It's why we delayed the
release for nearly a year to polish and improve everything - tests, internals,
performance, repo tooling, checks, release safeguards, and documentation.

We considered bigger changes for v2, but realized with AI getting good at
Tamagui and everything now working quite well, we're happier for now to keep
things iterative - we're already full-featured and fast, from now on, stability
is a feature.

Our goal is to get v3 out much more quickly than v2 took - we will deprecate a
few things soon after v2, and aim to release v3 in 6-12 months.
