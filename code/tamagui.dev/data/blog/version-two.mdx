<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui is the best way to build UI shared between React web and React Native
  without sacrificing quality, simplicity, types, or performance.
</IntroParagraph>

Tamagui's strength lies in it's maturity and depth: at about 200 packages, it
covers everything: performant and feature-rich styling, a large suite of
headless and composable UI components, powerful design system and theme
generation, a rich copy-paste component suite, and a ton of first-class starter
kits.

The core style library is the star: no other system brings as many style
features from CSS to native, and yet it also supports all features across:
native and web, server-side and client-side, and at both runtime and
compile-time. This results in incredible flexibility and performance.

It's the only universal style system that supports perfect SSR rendering with
light and dark mode without jumping or flickers, even when using spring-based
animation drivers and advanced media queries. Add in the optimizing compiler
that outputs near perfect platform-specific code, and your team can intuitive,
easy to maintain typed inline styles that merge perfectly and run fast
everywhere without worrying about the typical performance penalty.

In comparison to other solutions, Tamagui is especially strong at:

- _Able to share 100% between web and native._ Many other solutions focus on one
  platform more than others, or implement their features in sub-par ways on web.
- _Great performance and platform feeling on both web and native._ As a small
  example - you can choose from 4 animations drivers (CSS, Reanimated, Motion,
  React Native), per-platform, yet no matter which you choose proper SSR with
  media queries and dark mode properly renders and hydrates.
- _Fast, type-safe, properly mergeable inline styling._ Inline styles are a leap
  forward, but the lack of type safety or easy ability to merge and group your
  styles is their biggest drawback. Tamagui is fully type safe, lets you
  perfectly control how you merge styles per-component, optimizing it all nearly
  perfectly even in the face of complicated logic.
- _A first-class, composable components based UI kit._ Our UI kit is great at
  both native and web, has a first-class composable component API, and can
  easily adapt from one type of compoennt to another based on the device or
  media query.
- _Zero configuration._ We invested heavily into a custom build pipeline that
  outputs entirely separate files for native and web, with each having multiple
  custom transforms such that you **Tamagui doesn't need any setup at all, on
  any platform**. No bundler plugin, no babel transform, no matter if it's Vite,
  Metro, Webpack, Turbopack, you name it.

The result is that Tamagui is the only library that lets you ship world class
experiences on all platforms, with a lot less code. We're proud to be used by
companies like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), who leveraged Tamagui to unify
their featureset across platforms and greatly simplify their codebase.

### Improvements during v1

Tamagui improved continuously during version one:

- Added hundreds of tests, stricter lints, dependency checks and a stricter
  release process to improve stability.
- Created
  [`@tamagui/build`](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/v2/code/packages/build/README.md),
  the only way to publish npm packages that support both CommonJS and ESModules
  as well as native and web, all without requiring any configuration at all for
  end users.
- Added many styling features like container queries, container and media
  queries combined, and platform/theme selectors.
- New compound components like Tabs, Accordion, and ToggleGroup.
- Unstyled versions of every component.
- Improved theme generation packages, and released a free visual Theme builder.
- The Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.
- A lot of low level work on performance, documentation, our CLI, and more.

### New in v2

Version two adds some new Menu components, but beyond that is mostly a cleanup
release - it removes deprecated APIs, cleans up code and improves testing, and
refactors a couple slow components.

#### Rem Units on Native

You can now use rem units in your styles on native platforms:

```tsx
<View padding="1.5rem" fontSize="1rem" />
```

Rem values are calculated using `PixelRatio.getFontScale()`, so they
automatically respect the user's accessibility font size settings. Configure the
base size with `settings.remBaseFontSize` (defaults to 16).

#### Animation Delays

All animation drivers now support delays:

```tsx
<View animation={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

This works with CSS, React Native Animated, Reanimated, and Motion drivers.

#### Web-aligned Image and Input Components

Input and Image now follows a web-aligned APIs, with some old props supported
but deprecated.

The v1 versions of both components are is still available via:

```tsx
import { Input } from '@tamagui/input/v1'
import { Image } from '@tamagui/image/v1'
import { Input, Image } from 'tamagui/v1'
```

#### Button and List Component simplification

Button and List remove direct text style proper on the outer frame, and now only
support composition for better performance and flexibility:

```tsx
<Button>
  <Button.Icon icon={Plus} />
  <Button.Text>Add Item</Button.Text>
</Button>
```

This replaces the old approach of passing `icon` and text style props directly,
though you can still use the simple `<Button>Hello</Button>` pattern for simple
cases.

#### Breaking Changes

The breaking changes outside of deprecations are:

- Default `position` changed from `relative` to `static` to align with CSS
  defaults. Use `settings.defaultPosition: 'relative'` to restore old behavior.
- Default `flexBasis` changed from `auto` to `0` for flex items. Use
  `settings.styleCompat: 'legacy'` to restore old behavior.
- Button and ListItem use composition pattern instead of direct text/icon props.
- `useTheme()` no longer accepts props - use `<Theme>` component instead.
- Removed `themeInverse` prop and `<Theme inverse>` - use explicit theme names.
- Removed `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` - use `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`.
- Removed `createTheme` export - just use plain objects.
- Removed `setupReactNative` - auto-detection now handles this.
- Added 30+ web event handlers (keyboard, pointer, drag/drop, clipboard,
  scroll).
- Move from ThemeableStack to View for most UI component bases.

#### Deprecated APIs Removed

Things deprecated in version one that are now gone:

- `space`, `spaceDirection`, and `separator` props - use `gap` instead.
- `<Spacer />` moved from core to `@tamagui/spacer`.
- `themeClassNameOnRoot` replaced with `settings.addThemeClassName`.
- `extractable()` method - use `styleable()` instead.
- `selectable` prop on Text - use `userSelect` instead.
- `ellipse` prop on SizableText - renamed to `ellipsis`.
- `textAlignVertical` - use `verticalAlign` instead.
- `focusable` prop - use `tabIndex={0}` instead.
- `dataSet` prop - use `data-*` attributes directly.
- All root-level `createTamagui` settings moved to `settings` object.

#### Config v5

Our recommended default config, Config v4, evolves into a more mature setup with
v5. The good news is that v5 doesn't change any of the fundamentals - the
shorthands and media queries stay the same, though we've added a few more media
queries.

What v5 does add makes styling a lot easier - many more opacity values, shadow
values, a bit more refined colors, and much easier customization of sub-themes.

The new `createV5Theme()` factory makes for easier custom theme creation:

```tsx
import { createV5Theme } from '@tamagui/themes/v5'

const customThemes = createV5Theme({
  colors: {
    brand: { light: [...], dark: [...] }
  }
})
```

The v5 theme system also by default adds `alt1`, `alt2`, `surface1`, `surface2`,
`surface3`, and `accent` variants for all color themes.

#### Other Improvements

- **Insets support**: Pass `insets` to TamaguiProvider for safe area handling.
- **FocusGuard**: New `@tamagui/focus-guard` package for focus trapping.
- **Component classes**: All components now output `is_ComponentName` classes
  for easier debugging and CSS targeting.

#### Headless and Unstyled Components

During v2 we're expanding headless components. Many components now have three
variants:

- **Styled** - Full Tamagui components with default styles
- **Unstyled** - Uses a `createX` factory allowing fully custom styling
- **Headless** - Zero dependency on `@tamagui/core`, just hooks

The headless packages (`@tamagui/switch-headless`, `@tamagui/checkbox-headless`,
`@tamagui/radio-headless`, `@tamagui/tabs-headless`) provide hooks like
`useSwitch`, `useCheckbox`, `useRadioGroup`, and `useTabs` that handle all the
state management, accessibility, and keyboard navigation - letting you bring
your own styling solution.

This makes Tamagui components usable even if you're not using Tamagui for
styling. For now it's a subset, but we plan to continue expanding headless
exports throughout v2.

#### New Components

We've added two new menu components that automatically adapt to each platform:

##### Menu

[Menu](/docs/components/menu) provides dropdown menus with full keyboard
navigation, submenus, checkbox items, and animations. On iOS and Android, it
automatically renders using native platform menus.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <MenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Menu

```

##### ContextMenu

[ContextMenu](/docs/components/context-menu) works like Menu but activates on
right-click (web) or long-press (native). It includes support for preview
content on iOS.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ContextMenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>
```tsx hero template=ContextMenu

````

#### Matured Components

Several components that were in beta during v1 are now fully stable and
production-ready:

##### Tabs

[Tabs](/docs/components/tabs) provides keyboard-navigable tabbed interfaces with
smooth animations and full accessibility support.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TabsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tabs

````

##### Accordion

[Accordion](/docs/components/accordion) provides collapsible content sections
with customizable animations and single or multiple expansion modes.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <AccordionDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Accordion

```

##### Tooltip

[Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip) now uses floating positioning for smarter
placement that automatically adjusts to viewport boundaries.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TooltipDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tooltip

```

##### Image

[Image](/docs/components/image) provides cross-platform image handling with
consistent APIs across web and native.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ImageDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Image

```

### Goals

Our main goal with version two is **stability**. Tamagui started as a side
project with incredible scope and maintained an ambitious stance towards landing
large features and internal improvements, but that led to too many regression
during version one. I'd like to personally apologize for that.

For v2, we want to ensure that won't happen anymore. It's why we delayed the
release for nearly a year to polish and improve everything - tests, internals,
performance, repo tooling, checks, release safeguards, and documentation.

We considered bigger changes for v2, but realized with AI getting good at
Tamagui and everything now working quite well, we're happier for now to keep
things iterative - we're already full-featured and fast, from now on, stability
is a feature.
