<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui lets you build apps that share UI across React web and React Native
  without sacrificing quality, simplicity, or performance.
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is three things: a style library, an optimizing compiler, and a suite
  of UI components. It avoids the usual sacrifices in sharing code by simply
  going quite deep to make that possible. Some examples:
</IntroParagraph>

Tamagui brings many style features from CSS to native, yet all style primitives
work native and web, runtime and compile-time, server-side and client-side. You
get server-side rendering without flickering, even when using spring-based
animation drivers, or with media queries, or themes, and the optimizing compiler
means you can write natural inline styles without the typical performance cost.

In comparison to other solutions, Tamagui is especially strong at:

- _Able to share 100% between web and native._ Many other solutions focus on one
  platform more than others, or implement their features in sub-par ways on web.
- _Great performance and platform feeling on both web and native._ As a small
  example - you can choose from 4 animations drivers (CSS, Reanimated, Motion,
  React Native), per-platform, yet no matter which you choose proper SSR with
  media queries and dark mode properly renders and hydrates.
- _Fast, type-safe, properly mergeable inline styling._ Inline styles are a leap
  forward, but the lack of type safety or easy ability to merge and group your
  styles is their biggest drawback. Tamagui is fully type safe, lets you control
  how you merge styles, and optimizes it all nearly perfectly even in the face
  of complicated logic.
- _A first-class, composable components based UI kit._ Our UI kit doesn't just
  target one platform, uses composable components, and can even adapt based on
  the device.

The result is that Tamagui is the only library that lets you ship world class
experiences on all platforms, with a lot less code. We're proud to be used by
companies like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), who leveraged Tamagui to unify
their featureset across platforms and greatly simplify their codebase.

### Improvements during v1

Tamagui improved continuously during version one:

- Added hundreds of tests, stricter lints, dependency checks and a stricter
  release process to improve stability.
- Created
  [`@tamagui/build`](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/v2/code/packages/build/README.md),
  the only way to publish npm packages that support CommonJS and ESModules and
  native and web without requiring any configuration at all when importing -
  whether it's Metro, Node, Vite, or otherwise.
- Added many styling features like container queries, container and media
  queries combined, and platform/theme selectors.
- New compound components like Tabs, Accordion, and ToggleGroup.
- Unstyled versions of every component.
- Improved theme generation packages, and released a free visual Theme builder.
- The Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.
- A lot of low level work on performance, documentation, our CLI, and more.

### New in v2

Version two is mostly a cleanup release - it removes deprecated APIs, adds some
useful new features, and refactors a couple slow components.

#### Rem Units on Native

You can now use rem units in your styles on native platforms:

```tsx
<View padding="1.5rem" fontSize="1rem" />
```

Rem values are calculated using `PixelRatio.getFontScale()`, so they
automatically respect the user's accessibility font size settings. Configure the
base size with `settings.remBaseFontSize` (defaults to 16).

#### Animation Delays

All animation drivers now support delays:

```tsx
<View animation={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

This works with CSS, React Native Animated, Reanimated, and Motion drivers.

#### Input Component

Input now follows a web-aligned API, with the old props deprecated:

| Old (deprecated)   | New               |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `secureTextEntry`  | `type="password"` |
| `editable={false}` | `readOnly`        |
| `keyboardType`     | `type`            |
| `numberOfLines`    | `rows`            |

The v1 Input API is still available via `import { Input } from 'tamagui/v1'`.

#### Button Composition

Button now uses a composition pattern for better performance and flexibility:

```tsx
<Button>
  <Button.Icon icon={Plus} />
  <Button.Text>Add Item</Button.Text>
</Button>
```

This replaces the old approach of passing `icon` and text style props directly.

#### Breaking Changes

The breaking changes outside of deprecations are:

- Default `position` changed from `relative` to `static` to align with CSS
  defaults. Use `settings.defaultPosition: 'relative'` to restore old behavior.
- Default `flexBasis` changed from `auto` to `0` for flex items. Use
  `settings.styleCompat: 'legacy'` to restore old behavior.
- Button and ListItem use composition pattern instead of direct text/icon props.
- `useTheme()` no longer accepts props - use `<Theme>` component instead.
- Removed `themeInverse` prop and `<Theme inverse>` - use explicit theme names.
- Removed `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` - use `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`.
- Removed `createTheme` export - just use plain objects.
- Removed `setupReactNative` - auto-detection now handles this.
- Added 30+ web event handlers (keyboard, pointer, drag/drop, clipboard,
  scroll).
- Move from ThemeableStack to View for most UI component bases.

#### Deprecated APIs Removed

Things deprecated in version one that are now gone:

- `space`, `spaceDirection`, and `separator` props - use `gap` instead.
- `<Spacer />` moved from core to `@tamagui/spacer`.
- `themeClassNameOnRoot` replaced with `settings.addThemeClassName`.
- `extractable()` method - use `styleable()` instead.
- `ellipse` prop on Text - renamed to `ellipsis`.
- `selectable` prop on Text - use `userSelect` instead.
- `textAlignVertical` - use `verticalAlign` instead.
- `focusable` prop - use `tabIndex={0}` instead.
- `dataSet` prop - use `data-*` attributes directly.
- All root-level `createTamagui` settings moved to `settings` object.

#### Theme Improvements

The v5 theme configuration adds a new `createV5Theme()` factory for easier
custom theme creation, along with a new neutral color palette - 12 grays
designed to have sufficient contrast on both light and dark backgrounds.

```tsx
import { createV5Theme } from '@tamagui/themes/v5'

const customThemes = createV5Theme({
  colors: {
    brand: { light: [...], dark: [...] }
  }
})
```

The theme system also adds `alt1`, `alt2`, `surface1`, `surface2`, `surface3`,
and `accent` variants for all color themes.

#### Other Improvements

- **Insets support**: Pass `insets` to TamaguiProvider for safe area handling.
- **FocusGuard**: New `@tamagui/focus-guard` package for focus trapping.
- **Component classes**: All components now output `is_ComponentName` classes
  for easier debugging and CSS targeting.

#### Headless and Unstyled Components

During v2 we're expanding headless components. Many components now have three
variants:

- **Styled** - Full Tamagui components with default styles
- **Unstyled** - Uses a `createX` factory allowing fully custom styling
- **Headless** - Zero dependency on `@tamagui/core`, just hooks

The headless packages (`@tamagui/switch-headless`, `@tamagui/checkbox-headless`,
`@tamagui/radio-headless`, `@tamagui/tabs-headless`) provide hooks like
`useSwitch`, `useCheckbox`, `useRadioGroup`, and `useTabs` that handle all the
state management, accessibility, and keyboard navigation - letting you bring
your own styling solution.

This makes Tamagui components usable even if you're not using Tamagui for
styling. For now it's a subset, but we plan to continue expanding headless
exports throughout v2.

#### New Components

We've added two new menu components that automatically adapt to each platform:

##### Menu

[Menu](/docs/components/menu) provides dropdown menus with full keyboard
navigation, submenus, checkbox items, and animations. On iOS and Android, it
automatically renders using native platform menus.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <MenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Menu

```

##### ContextMenu

[ContextMenu](/docs/components/context-menu) works like Menu but activates on
right-click (web) or long-press (native). It includes support for preview
content on iOS.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ContextMenuDemo />
</HeroContainer>
```tsx hero template=ContextMenu

```

#### Matured Components

Several components that were in beta during v1 are now fully stable and
production-ready:

##### Tabs

[Tabs](/docs/components/tabs) provides keyboard-navigable tabbed interfaces with
smooth animations and full accessibility support.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TabsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tabs

```

##### Accordion

[Accordion](/docs/components/accordion) provides collapsible content sections
with customizable animations and single or multiple expansion modes.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <AccordionDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Accordion

```

##### Tooltip

[Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip) now uses floating positioning for smarter
placement that automatically adjusts to viewport boundaries.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <TooltipDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Tooltip

```

##### Image

[Image](/docs/components/image) provides cross-platform image handling with
consistent APIs across web and native.

<HeroContainer tinted>
  <ImageDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=Image

```

### Goals

Our main goal with version two is **stability**. Tamagui started as a side
project with incredible scope and maintained an ambitious stance towards landing
large features and internal improvements, but that led to too many regression
during version one. I'd like to personally apologize for that.

For v2, we want to ensure that won't happen anymore. It's why we delayed the
release for nearly a year to polish and improve everything - tests, internals,
performance, repo tooling, checks, release safeguards, and documentation.

We considered bigger changes for v2, but realized with AI getting good at
Tamagui and everything now working quite well, we're happier for now to keep
things iterative - we're already full-featured and fast, from now on, stability
is a feature.
