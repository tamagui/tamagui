<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui lets you build apps that share UI across React web and React Native
  without sacrificing quality, simplicity, or performance.
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is three things: a style library, an optimizing compiler, and a suite
  of UI components. It avoids the usual sacrifices in sharing code by simply
  going quite deep to make that possible. Some examples:
</IntroParagraph>

- It brings many style features from CSS to native, yet all style primitives
  work native and web, runtime and compile-time, server-side and client-side.
- Enjoy server-side rendering without flickering, even when using spring-based
  animation drivers, or with media queries, or themes.
- The optimizing compiler handles logic via complete partial analysis to output
  flat trees with platform-specific optimization.

The result is that Tamagui lets you ship world class experiences without being
forced to write all your UI two or more times, and without downgrading your
developer experience. We're proud to be used by companies like
[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), where we enabled a dramatic reduction in code
duplication, while increasing shipping velocity and maintaining top-tier UX and
performance.

### Improvements during v1

Tamagui improved continously during major version one:

- Added hundreds of tests, stricter lints, dependency checks and a stricter
  release process to improve stability.
- Created
  [`@tamagui/build`](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/v2/code/packages/build/README.md),
  the only way to publish npm packages that support CommonJS and ESModules and
  native and web without requiring any configuration at all when importing -
  whether it's Metro, Node, Vite, or otherwise.
- Added many styling features like container queries, container and media
  queries combined, and platform/theme selectors.
- New compound components like Tabs, Accordion, and ToggleGroup.
- Unstyled versions of every component.
- Improved theme generation packages, and released a free visual Theme builder.
- The Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.
- A lot of low level work on performance, documentation, our CLI, and more.

### New in v2

Version two is mostly a cleanup release - it has few breaking changes. It mostly
removes deprecated APIs, while adding a couple new components and refactoring a
couple slow ones.

The breaking changes outside of deprecations are:

- Default flex and position styles align with the latest React Native versions,
  but you can change settings to keep the legacy behavior.
- Button and ListItem lose direct text style props, to gain performance.
- useTheme no longer takes props, must be changed using a component.

Things depreciated in version one that are now gone:

- Removed `space` and `spaceDirection` props in favor of gap.
- Moved the `<Spacer />` component from core into `@tamagui/spacer`.
- Moved all settings on `createTamagui` onto the `settings` object.

### Goals

Our main goal with version two is **stability**. Tamagui started as a side
project with incredible scope, and has been ambitious in landing large internal
improvements and features along the way.

To be honest - a lack of rigor in both adding native tests and in using canaries
before actual releases meant we were not as stable as we should have been, and
we apologize to anyone who wasted time due to regressions. We decided to push
back the release of version two for over a year mostly because we wanted to
prove to ourselves that we had a solid, reliable setup going forward.

What's changed?

- We've added over 500 tests, especially improving our native test suite.
- We slowed down releases and added a variety of new checks to releases.
- We spent time to fix hundreds of bugs via our issue backlog, with tests.
- We made our canary release process simpler, and now use it much more often.
- We mostly "caught up" with the major internals improvements we wanted to land.

### What's next

Tamagui is quite mature in terms of features and foundation. We likely won't add
many components, but may add a few powerful features especially in terms of
adapting UI.

Mostly we'd like to continuing to fix bugs, continue aligning it with web
standards, and generally making it more flexible and easy to use with better
documentation and onboarding.
