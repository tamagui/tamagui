While the `space` property is deprecated, Unspaced lives on in a better form, one which is easily back-ported to add Unspaced support (as well as adding `gap` support).

When using the `space` style prop, you may want some children to not be spaced.

Use Unspaced:

```tsx
import { Text, Unspaced, View } from '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <View position="relative" space>
    <View width={20} height={20} />
    {/* space */}
    <View width={20} height={20} />
    {/* no */}
    <Unspaced>
      <Text position="absolute">Some absolute positioned text</Text>
    </Unspaced>
  </View>
)
```

If you want the item to be visually hidden as well as unspaced, see
[VisuallyHidden](/docs/components/visually-hidden), which avoids uses Unspaced but also hides the contents in an accessible manner.
