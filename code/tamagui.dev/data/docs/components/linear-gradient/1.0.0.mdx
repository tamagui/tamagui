<Highlights
  features={[
    'Works on native and web.',
    'Accepts Tamagui style props and theme colors.',
    'Bundles easily with webpack.',
  ]}
/>

## Installation

LinearGradient is already installed in `tamagui`, or you can install it independently:

```bash
npm install @tamagui/linear-gradient
```

To use this package you'll need to add `expo-linear-gradient` to your app. This works [with vanilla React Native](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/sdk-47/packages/expo-linear-gradient) or Expo.

## Usage

Because LinearGradient requires a more complex to install native package, we've left it out of the `tamagui` export until Metro supports async import. Import it either separately or using the path `/linear-gradient`:

```tsx
import { LinearGradient } from '@tamagui/linear-gradient'
import { LinearGradient } from 'tamagui/linear-gradient'
```

LinearGradient is a YStack that accepts all Tamagui style props as well as theme colors, that places `expo-linear-gradient` inside it set to absoluteFill.

## API Reference

### LinearGradient

See the [expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/) for more complete information.

LinearGradient extends YStack, inheriting [Stack props](/docs/components/stacks) and therefore the [Tamagui standard props](/docs/intro/props), plus:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'colors',
      required: true,

    },
    {
      name: 'locations',
      required: false,
      type: 'number[] | null',
      description: `An array that contains numbers ranging from 0 to 1, inclusive, and is the same length as the colors property. Each number indicates a color-stop location where each respective color should be located.`,
      default: '[0.0, 1.0]',
    },
    {
      name: 'start',
      required: false,
      type: 'LinearGradientPoint | null',
      default: '{ x: 0.5, y: 0.0 }',

    },

    },
