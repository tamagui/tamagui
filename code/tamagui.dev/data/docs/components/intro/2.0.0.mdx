<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui UI is a complete suite of copy-paste composable components that render nicely on
  both React Native and React web, in both styled and unstyled forms.
</IntroParagraph>

You can install each component separately, or all of them at once with:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

## Setup

The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`, so if you've already installed core you can change all the references to `tamagui`.

You'll need to add a provider to the root of your app (unlike core, where that is optional), as it will set up the root portal for components like dialogs and popovers.

```tsx
import { createTamagui, TamaguiProvider, View } from 'tamagui'
import { defaultConfig } from '@tamagui/config/v5' // for quick config install this

const config = createTamagui(defaultConfig)

export default () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
    <View />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

For a full configuration guide with `createTamagui`, check [the core configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration).
