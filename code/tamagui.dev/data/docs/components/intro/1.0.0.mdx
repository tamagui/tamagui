# Tamagui UI

<Description>
  Common UI elements for React Native and web.
</Description>

<IntroParagraph>
Tamagui UI is a bunch of Open Source components that render nicely on both React Native and React web, adapt to each other, and come in both styled and unstyled forms.
</IntroParagraph>

Many components now [Adapt](/ui/popover) to render as different components depending on platform or capability. A few components have `native` adaptations where they can render to platform-native output.

Install them separately, or all at once with:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

## Setup

The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`, so if you've already installed core you can change all the references to `tamagui`.

You'll need to add a provider to the root of your app (unlike core, where that is optional), as it will set up the root portal for components like dialogs and popovers.

```tsx
import { createTamagui,TamaguiProvider, View } from 'tamagui'
import { defaultConfig } from '@tamagui/config/v4' // for quick config install this

const config = createTamagui(defaultConfig)

export default () => (
  <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
    <View />
  </TamaguiProvider>
)
```

For a full guide configuration with `createTamagui`, check [the core configuration docs](/docs/core/configuration).
