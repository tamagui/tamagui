Portal is included in `tamagui` and is used by [Sheet](/docs/components/sheet),
[Dialog](/docs/components/dialog), [Popover](/docs/components/popover),
[Select](/docs/components/select), and [Toast](/docs/components/toast).

## Native Portal Setup (Recommended)

On web, React's built-in `createPortal` preserves context automatically. On
native, the default portal implementation doesn't preserve React context.
Tamagui automatically re-propagates its own contexts (theme, configuration), but
your custom contexts like navigation or app state won't be available inside
portaled content. The re-propagation also adds some overhead.

We recommend using
[react-native-teleport](https://github.com/nicksrandall/react-native-teleport)
to solve this. It uses React Native's native portal API to preserve context
automatically.

### Step 1: Install react-native-teleport

```bash
npm install react-native-teleport
```

### Step 2: Import the setup module

In your app's entry file (index.js or App.tsx), before any Tamagui imports:

```tsx
import '@tamagui/native/setup-teleport'
```

That's it! All portal-using components will now preserve context automatically
on native. Without native portals, your custom context from parent components
won't be available inside portaled content:

```tsx
const MyContext = createContext('default')

function App() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value="from-provider">
      <Sheet modal open>
        <Sheet.Frame>
          {/* Without native portal: you'd not have context here on native */}
          <MyConsumer />
        </Sheet.Frame>
      </Sheet>
    </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Alternative Approaches

If you can't use react-native-teleport, there are other ways to handle context
in portals:

### Component Scoping

For Dialog, Popover, and Tooltip, use the `scope` prop to mount a single
instance at your app root. This avoids portals entirely on native:

```tsx
// _layout.tsx - mount once at root with all your providers
<TamaguiProvider>
  <Tooltip scope="global">
    <Tooltip.Content>
      <Tooltip.Arrow />
      <Paragraph>{/* label set by trigger */}</Paragraph>
    </Tooltip.Content>

    {/* rest of your app */}
    <Slot />
  </Tooltip>
</TamaguiProvider>

// anywhere in your app - just the trigger
<Tooltip.Trigger scope="global" aria-label="Settings">
  <Button icon={Settings} />
</Tooltip.Trigger>
```

This pattern is also a performance win for lists or tables with many interactive
elements.

### Manual Context Re-propagation

Wrap portal children with the necessary providers:

```tsx
const theme = useTheme()
const myValue = useContext(MyContext)

<Sheet>
  <Sheet.Frame>
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <MyContext.Provider value={myValue}>
        {/* content that needs context */}
      </MyContext.Provider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </Sheet.Frame>
</Sheet>
```

This is more verbose and error-prone as you need to remember to re-propagate
every context you use.

## API Reference

### Portal

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'zIndex',
      type: 'number',
      description: `Fixed z-index value for the portal.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'stackZIndex',
      type: `boolean | number | 'global'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          Enable automatic z-index stacking. Tamagui intelligently stacks z-index both horizontally
          (based on mount order) and vertically (nested content is always above parent but below
          sibling content that comes after). <code>true</code> enables stacking, a number adds to the
          stacked value, <code>'global'</code> only stacks horizontally without nesting logic.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'passThrough',
      type: 'boolean',
      description: `When true, renders children directly without portal behavior.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

This automatic stacking is already enabled by default in Dialog, Popover, Sheet, and other overlay
components. If you open a Popover from within a Dialog, the Popover will automatically have a
higher z-index than the Dialog without any configuration needed.

## Technical Details

[react-native-teleport](https://github.com/nicksrandall/react-native-teleport)
uses `ReactNativeFabricUIManager.createPortal` (Fabric) or
`UIManager.createPortal` (Paper) to create true native portals that preserve the
React fiber tree.

The default portal implementation, by contrast, uses a JS-based approach with
context providers and a reducer to manage portal state. While compatible with
older RN versions, it breaks React context because it re-renders content in a
separate provider tree.

Tamagui includes a `needsPortalRepropagation()` helper that returns `true` when
using the default portal implementation and `false` when using native portals,
so library authors can conditionally re-propagate context only when needed.
