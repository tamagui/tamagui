Portal is included in `tamagui` as it's used by a few components. It uses [@gorhom/portal](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal) as its base.

## Context and Portals

Because portals render outside the normal React tree, React context from parent components won't be available inside portaled content by default.

There are two approaches to handle this:

### 1. Use Component Scoping (Recommended)

For components like Dialog, Popover, and Tooltip, you can use the `scope` prop to hoist a single instance to your app root while placing triggers anywhere. This avoids context issues entirely since the content lives at the root inside your providers:

```tsx
// _layout.tsx - mount once at root with all your providers
<TamaguiProvider>
  <Tooltip scope="global">
    <Tooltip.Content>
      <Tooltip.Arrow />
      <Paragraph>{/* label set by trigger */}</Paragraph>
    </Tooltip.Content>

    {/* rest of your app */}
    <Slot />
  </Tooltip>
</TamaguiProvider>

// anywhere in your app - just the trigger
<Tooltip.Trigger scope="global" aria-label="Settings">
  <Button icon={Settings} />
</Tooltip.Trigger>
```

This pattern is also a performance win for lists or tables with many interactive elements, and avoids needing portals entirely on native.

For Sheet, scoping isn't yet available, but you can achieve a similar pattern by mounting a single Sheet at your app root and controlling it via context or a state emitter. This avoids portal context issues on native.

### 2. Re-propagate Context

If you need context inside portaled content, wrap the portal children with the necessary providers:

```tsx
const theme = useTheme()

<Sheet>
  <Sheet.Frame>
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* content that needs theme context */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  </Sheet.Frame>
</Sheet>
```

## Native Portal Setup (Advanced)

By default, portals use the Gorhom portal implementation which works well for most cases.

If you want to use React Native's native `createPortal` API instead, you can opt-in by calling `setupNativePortal` early in your app. This is an unofficial API that may have compatibility issues with newer React Native versions:

```tsx
// in index.js or App.tsx, before rendering
import { setupNativePortal } from '@tamagui/portal/native-portal'

setupNativePortal()
```
