title: Tamagui Props
description: All the base props
---

Tamagui supports a superset of the React Native props. Start with:

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), or
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)

From there, we add [style props](/docs/intro/styles) directly onto the same
object.

Finally, there are a few non-style props Tamagui adds:

## Event Props

All Tamagui View-based components have Pressable-like functionality built in. You don't need to wrap in `Pressable` or `TouchableOpacity` - add event handlers directly:

```tsx
<View
  onPress={() => console.log('pressed')}
  onHoverIn={() => console.log('hovered')}
  pressStyle={{ opacity: 0.8 }}
  hoverStyle={{ backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover' }}
/>
```

/>

Use these events alongside style states like `pressStyle`, `hoverStyle`, and `focusStyle` to create interactive components. See the [Style API](/docs/intro/styles) for styling on interaction states.

      description: (
        <span>
          When set Tamagui will output a variety of helpful information on how it parsed and

          the start of render in development mode.

      description: (
        <span>
          When true, Tamagui expects a single child element. Instead of rendering its own element, it will pass all props to that child, merging together any event handling props. When "except-style", the same behavior except Tamagui won't pass styles down from the parent, only non-style props.

      description: (
        <span>
          Advanced use only. React will "re-parent" components when it's internal tree structure changes.
          When making UI that adapts to another look, for better performance and avoiding losing user state (like focus, or uncontrolled text input), you can use passThrough rather than conditionally rendering a wrapping component.
        </span>
      ),

## Event Handlers

Tamagui supports all React Native events on all platforms. On web, we also support all standard DOM event handlers:

### Cross-Platform Events
- `onPress`, `onLongPress`, `onPressIn`, `onPressOut` - Touch/press events that work on both native and web

### Web-Only Events
The following events are available on web and automatically ignored on native:

**Mouse Events**
- `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`, `onContextMenu`
- `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`
- `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`
- `onWheel`

**Keyboard Events**
- `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, `onKeyPress`

**Pointer Events** - Modern events that work across mouse, touch, and pen:
- `onPointerDown`, `onPointerUp`, `onPointerMove`
- `onPointerEnter`, `onPointerLeave`, `onPointerCancel`

**Drag and Drop**
- `onDrag`, `onDragStart`, `onDragEnd`
- `onDragEnter`, `onDragLeave`, `onDragOver`
- `onDrop`

**Input Events**
- `onChange`, `onInput`, `onBeforeInput`

**Scroll Events**
- `onScroll`

**Clipboard Events**
- `onCopy`, `onCut`, `onPaste`

**Focus Events**
- `onFocus`, `onBlur`

All event handlers receive the standard React synthetic event as their argument.
