description: The Tamagui superset of React Native styles
---

Tamagui supports a superset of the React Native style properties - either to the
`styled()` function as the second argument, or directly as props on the View and
Text base components.

Here's how that looks in practice:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

const StyledView = styled(View, {
  padding: 10,
})

const MyView = () => (
  <StyledView
    backgroundColor="red"
    hoverStyle={{
      backgroundColor: 'green'
    }}
  />
)
```

The types for the full set of styles accepted by styled, View and Text are
exported as `ViewStyle` and `TextStyle`.

For the full base styles, see the React Native docs:

- [React Native View style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props)
- [React Native Text style props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)

The full Tamagui typed style props can be simplified to something like this,
except the values can accept `"unset"` or one of your design tokens:

```tsx
import { ViewStyle as RNViewStyle } from 'react-native'

type BaseViewStyle = RNViewStyle & FlatTransformStyles & WebOnlyStyles

// these are accepted but only render on web:
type WebOnlyStyles =  {
  contain?: Properties['contain']
  touchAction?: Properties['touchAction']
  cursor?: Properties['cursor']
  outlineColor?: Properties['outlineColor']
  outlineOffset?: SpaceValue
  outlineStyle?: Properties['outlineStyle']
  outlineWidth?: SpaceValue
  userSelect?: Properties['userSelect']
  filter?: Properties['filter']
  backdropFilter?: Properties['backdropFilter']
  mixBlendMode?: Properties['mixBlendMode']
  backgroundImage?: Properties['backgroundImage']
  backgroundOrigin: Properties['backgroundOrigin'],
  backgroundPosition: Properties['backgroundPosition'],
  backgroundRepeat: Properties['backgroundRepeat'],
  backgroundSize: Properties['backgroundSize']
  backgroundColor: Properties['backgroundColor']
  backgroundClip: Properties['backgroundClip']
  backgroundBlendMode: Properties['backgroundBlendMode']
  backgroundAttachment: Properties['backgroundAttachment']
  background: Properties['background']
  clipPath: Properties['clipPath'],
  caretColor: Properties['caretColor']
  transformStyle: Properties['transformStyle'],
  mask: Properties['mask'],
  maskImage: Properties['maskImage'],
  textEmphasis: Properties['textEmphasis'],
  borderImage: Properties['borderImage'],
  float: Properties['float']
  content: Properties['content']
  overflowBlock: Properties['overflowBlock']
  overflowInline: Properties['overflowInline']
  maskBorder: Properties['maskBorder']
  maskBorderMode: Properties['maskBorderMode']
  maskBorderOutset: Properties['maskBorderOutset']
  maskBorderRepeat: Properties['maskBorderRepeat']
  maskBorderSlice: Properties['maskBorderSlice']
  maskBorderSource: Properties['maskBorderSource']
  maskBorderWidth: Properties['maskBorderWidth']
  maskClip: Properties['maskClip']
  maskComposite: Properties['maskComposite']
  maskMode: Properties['maskMode']
  maskOrigin: Properties['maskOrigin']
  maskPosition: Properties['maskPosition']
  maskRepeat: Properties['maskRepeat']
  maskSize: Properties['maskSize']
  maskType: Properties['maskType']
}

// these turn into the equivalent transform style props:
type FlatTransformStyles = {
  x?: number
  y?: number
  perspective?: number
  scale?: number
  scaleX?: number
  scaleY?: number
  skewX?: string
  skewY?: string
  matrix?: number[]
  rotate?: string
  rotateY?: string
  rotateX?: string
  rotateZ?: string
}

// add the pseudo and enter/exit style states
type WithStates = BaseViewStyle & {
  hoverStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  pressStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  focusStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  focusVisibleStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  disabledStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  enterStyle?: BaseViewStyle
  exitStyle?: BaseViewStyle
}

// final View style props
type ViewStyle = WithStates & {
  // add media queries
  $sm?: WithStates

  // add group queries
  $group-hover?: WithStates
  $group-focus?: WithStates
  $group-press?: WithStates

  // add group + container queries
  $group-sm-hover?: WithStates
  $group-sm-focus?: WithStates
  $group-sm-press?: WithStates

  // add named group queries
  $group-tabs?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-hover?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-focus?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-press?: WithStates

  // add named group + container queries
  $group-tabs-sm?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-sm-hover?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-sm-focus?: WithStates
  $group-tabs-sm-press?: WithStates

  // add theme queries
  $theme-light?: WithStates
  $theme-dark?: WithStates

  // add platform queries
  $platform-native?: WithStates
  $platform-ios?: WithStates
  $platform-android?: WithStates
  $platform-web?: WithStates
}

// Text style starts with this base but builds up the same:
type TextStyleBase = BaseViewStyle & {
  color?: string,
  fontFamily?: string,
  fontSize?: string,
  fontStyle?: string,
  fontWeight?: string,
  letterSpacing?: string,
  lineHeight?: string,
  textAlign?: string,
  textDecorationColor?: string,
  textDecorationLine?: string,
  textDecorationStyle?: string,
  textShadowColor?: string,
  textShadowOffset?: string,
  textShadowRadius?: string,
  textTransform?: string,
}
```

## Parent based styling

Tamagui has a variety of ways to style a child based on the "parent", a parent
being one of: platform, screen size, theme, or group. All of these styles use
the same pattern, they use a `$` prefix for their styles, and they nest styles
as a sub-object.

For example you can target `$theme-light`, `$platform-ios`, or `$group-header`.
For screen size, which we call media queries, they have no prefix. Instead you
define media queries on `createTamagui`. For example, if you define a media
query named `large`, then `$large` is the prop name.

These parent style props accept all the Tamagui style props in their value
object.

#### Media query

Based on whatever media queries you define in `createTamagui`, you can now use
any of them to apply styling on native and web using the `$` prefix.

If you defined your media query like:

```tsx
createTamagui({
  media: {
    sm: { maxWidth: 800 },
  },
})
```

Then you can use it like:

```tsx
<Text color="red" $sm={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

### Theme

Theme style props let you style a child based on a parent theme. At the moment,
they only can target your top level themes, so if you have `light`, and
`light_subtle` themes, then only `light` can be targeted.

Use them like so:

```tsx
<Text $theme-dark={{ color: 'white' }} />
```

### Platform

Platform style props let you style a child based on the platform the app is
running on. This can be one of `ios`, `android`, `web`, or `native` (iOS and
Android).

Use it like so:

```tsx
<Text $platform-ios={{ color: 'white' }} />
```

### Group

Groups are a new feature in beta that lets you define a named group, and then
style children based whether they are inside a parent that is given that group
name.

A short example:

```tsx
<View group="header">
  <Text $group-header={{ color: 'white' }} />
</View>
```

This will make the Text turn white, as it's inside a parent item with `group`
set to the matching `header` value.

Group styles also allow for targeting the parent pseudo state:

```tsx
<View group>
  <Text $group-hover={{ color: 'white' }} />
</View>
```

Now only when the parent View is hovered the Text will turn white. The allowed
psuedo modifiers are `hover` (web only), `press`, and `focus`.

For more advanced usecases you can use named groups

```tsx
<View group="card">
  <Text>Outer</Text>
  <View group>
    <Text $group-card-hover={{ color: 'blue' }}>Inner</Text>
    <Text $group-hover={{ color: 'green' }}>Sibling</Text>
  </View>
</View>
```

Now the `Inner` Text will turn blue when the `card` group is hovered,
and the `Sibling` Text will turn green when its parent is hovered.

To make this typed, you need to set `TypeOverride` alongside the same area you
set up your Tamagui types:

```tsx
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // if you want types for group styling props, define them like so:
  interface TypeOverride {
    groupNames(): 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
  }
}
```

#### Group Container

The final feature of group styles is the ability to style a child only when the
parent is of a certain size. On the web these are known as "container queries",
which is what Tamagui outputs as CSS under the hood. They look like this:

```tsx
<View group>
  <Text
    $group-sm={{ color: 'white' }}
    $group-sm-hover={{ color: 'green' }}
  />
</View>
```

Now the Text will be white, but only when the View matches the media query
`sm`. This uses the same media query breakpoints you defined in
`createTamagui({ media })`. You can see it also works with pseudo styles!

For more advanced use cases, you can use named groups with container queries:

```tsx
<View group="card">
  <View group>
    <Text
      $group-card-sm={{ color: 'white' }}
      $group-card-sm-hover={{ color: 'green' }}
    />
    <Text
      $group-sm={{ color: 'white' }}
      $group-sm-hover={{ color: 'green' }}
    />
  </View>
</View>
```

Now the first Text will be white when the `card` parent matches `sm`, and
the second Text will be white when no named parent matches `sm`.

_A note on group containers and native_

On Native, we don't have access to the layout of a React component as it first
renders. Only once we get the dimensions from the `onLayout` callback after the
first render are we able to apply group container styles.

Because of this, we've done two things.

First, there's a new property `untilMeasured`:

```tsx
<View group untilMeasured="hide">
  <Text
    $group-sm={{
      color: 'white',
    }}
  />
</View>
```

This takes two options, `show` or `hide`. If unset it defaults to `show`, which
means it will render before it measures. With `hide` set, the container will be
set to `opacity` 0 until it finishes measuring.

Alternatively, if you know the dimensions your container will be up-front, you
can set width and height on the container. When either of these are set, the
children will attempt to use these values on first render and if they satisfy
the media query, you'll avoid the need for a double render altogether.

## Style order is important

One thing that's very important to understand in Tamagui is that style props are
sensitive to their order - a feature that without which would leave us with
impossible styling challenges and awkward rules of inheritence we're trying to
get away from with CSS in JS. Let's first explain how it works, and then why
it's necessary.

Define a new styled component:

```tsx
const CalHeader = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    isHero: {
      true: {
        fontSize: 36,
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        color: 'white',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

And then use it in a view you're building:

```tsx
export const MyCalendar = (props: { isHero?: boolean; headerFontSize?: number }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {/* ... some other components... */}
      <CalHeader isHero={props.isHero} fontSize={props.headerFontSize}>
        {monthName}
      </CalHeader>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Why it's important

Notice two things: `isHero` sets a variety of properties, but you want to allow
overriding one of those properties, `fontSize`.

If Tamagui didn't respect the order of the props on the JSX element of
`CalHeader`, you wouldn't know if the `isHero` font size wins, or if the
`headerFontSize` wins.

CSS does a "last defined style wins", which is a huge pain because it means you
have to carefully manage the order your CSS is actually loaded into the
document. Tamagui could do something similar, with a "inline props always win,
defined props go in order of definition", but this would be dramatically less
flexible.

Especially when it comes to spreading props downwards. Because Tamagui supports
prop order, you have complete control over which styles you want to always win,
vs which can be overridden by a user:

```tsx
export const MyCalendarHeader = (props: CalHeaderProps) => {
  return (
    <CalHeader isHero {...props} fontSize={36}>
      {monthName}
    </CalHeader>
  )
}
```

This component defaults to `isHero` styles, but if a user passes in `isHero` as
`false`, it will disable all those styles. But because `fontSize` is **always**
after the spread, it will always be set to 36.
