title: Tamagui Compiler
description: Adding the compiler to your apps
---

<IntroParagraph>
  The Tamagui Compiler significantly improves performance of both web and native applications
  through partial analysis and view flattening.
</IntroParagraph>

See the [Benchmarks](/docs/intro/benchmarks). Note that the Tamagui Compiler is optional.
It's much easier to start without setting it up, and add it once you're ready for production.

The Compiler is a babel plugin that analyzes JSX and `styled` calls, and attempts to parse out all props and 
values using some logic for Babel, and the Node `vm` package to pass in context and analyze expressions.

The end result is plain old `div` (and other tag) output on web, or on native, outputting plain old React Native `View` and `Text`:

<TamaguiExamplesCode />

<Notice>
  The compiler generates built versions of your components and config into a
`.tamagui` directory. You'll want to add that directory to your `.gitignore`.
</Notice>

We have plugins for a variety of bundlers:

### Webpack

```bash
yarn add tamagui-loader
```

We have a full example of a plain Webpack or Vite setup in the simple starter
accessible through `npm create tamagui@latest`, which shows a complete
configuration with more detail.

Add `tamagui-loader` and set up your `webpack.config.js`.

You can set it up more manually like so:

```js
const { shouldExclude } = require('tamagui-loader')

const tamaguiOptions = {
  config: './tamagui.config.ts',
  components: ['tamagui'],
  importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],
  logTimings: true,
  disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  // optional advanced optimization of styled() definitions within your app itself, not just ones in your components option
  // default is false
  enableDynamicEvaluation: false,
}

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // Resolve react-native to react-native-web
      'react-native$': require.resolve('react-native-web'),
      // optional, for lighter svg icons on web
      'react-native-svg': require.resolve('@tamagui/react-native-svg'),
    }
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
        // you'll likely want to adjust this helper function,
        // but it serves as a decent start that you can copy/paste from
        exclude: path => shouldExclude(path, __dirname, tamaguiOptions),
        use: [
          // optionally thread-loader for significantly faster compile!
          'thread-loader',

          // works nicely alongside esbuild
          {
            loader: 'esbuild-loader',
          },

          {
            loader: 'tamagui-loader',
            options: tamaguiOptions,
          },
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
}
```

Or you can use the TamaguiPlugin which automates some of this setup for you:

```tsx
const { TamaguiPlugin } = require('tamagui-loader')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new TamaguiPlugin({
      config: './tamagui.config.ts',
      components: ['tamagui'],
      importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],
      logTimings: true,
      disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
    }),
  ],
}
```

Some notes on the options:

- _importsWhitelist_: Tamagui takes a conservative approach to partial
  evaluation, this field whitelists (matching against both .ts and .js) files to
  allow files that import them to read and use their values during compilation.
  Typically colors and constants files.
- _disableExtraction_: Useful for faster developer iteration as your design
  system hot reloads more reliably.

### Vite

See the [Vite guide](/docs/guides/vite) for more complete setup.

Add `@tamagui/vite-plugin` and update your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { tamaguiPlugin } from '@tamagui/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tamaguiPlugin({
      // points to your tamagui config file
      config: 'src/tamagui.config.ts',
      // points to any linked packages or node_modules
      // that have tamagui components to optimize
      components: ['tamagui'],
      // turns on the optimizing compiler
      optimize: true,
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Next.js

See the ([guide](/docs/guides/next-js)) for more complete setup.

Add `@tamagui/next-plugin` and configure your `next.config.js`. Here we show a
fuller scope of the options

```js
// note next-compose-plugins somewhat unmaintained
// you can use a simple two-liner instead, see:
// https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins/issues/59#issuecomment-1192523231
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')
const { withTamagui } = require('@tamagui/next-plugin')

export default withPlugins([
  withTamagui({
    config: './tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['tamagui'],

    // rest are all optional:

    // disable static extraction, faster to iterate in dev mode (default false)
    disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',

    // Exclude react-native-web modules to lighten bundle
    excludeReactNativeWebExports: ['Switch', 'ProgressBar', 'Picker'],

    // By default, we configure webpack to pass anything inside your root or design system
    // to the Tamagui loader. If you are importing files from an external package, use this:
    shouldExtract: (path: string, projectRoot: string) => {
      if (path.includes('../packages/myapp')) {
        return true
      }
    },

    // Advanced:

    // Many packages give difficulty to the nextjs server-side (node) runtime when un-bundled.
    // for example, tamagui configures aliases like react-native => react-native-web.
    // if you're running into a module that has errors importing react-native, you'll want to
    // use a custom shouldExcludeFromServer function to include it (or override the default).
    // this is the exact same return type as webpack.externals.
    // returning undefined will let tamagui handle it, boolean or other values to override.
    shouldExcludeFromServer: ({ fullPath, request }) => {
      if (fullPath.includes('my-module')) {
        return 'commonjs ' + commonjs
      }
      if (request === 'some-hard-to-bundle-package') {
        return true
      }
    },
  })
])
```

Note: If running into issues, the environment variable `IGNORE_TS_CONFIG_PATHS`
to "true" can fix issues with Tamagui being resolved incorrectly.

See the [Next.js Guide](/docs/guides/next-js) for more details on setting up
your app.

#### Babel / Metro

Note that the `@tamagui/babel-plugin` is completely optional, and on native
Tamagui doesn't optimize as much as on web, so leaving it out is actually
recommended to start. If later on you feel the need for a bit more speed, you
can try adding it.

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/babel-plugin
```

Add to your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      '@tamagui/babel-plugin',
      {
        components: ['tamagui'],
        config: './tamagui.config.ts',
        importsWhitelist: ['constants.js', 'colors.js'],
        logTimings: true,
        disableExtraction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
      }
    ],
  ]
}
```

Currently the native compiler doesn't optimize as much as it could. It bails out
if it encounters any theme usage, like `<View backgroundColor="$background" />`.
If you are on version `1.75` or greater, you can test enabling this experimental
optimization by adding a new property with the key
`experimentalFlattenThemesOnNative` set to true in the above config object and
that will make the compiler to flat and extract any theme usage or dynamic
values.

#### Expo

[Check out the Expo guide](/docs/guides/expo) for more information on setting up
Expo.

### Web-only apps

If you want autocompleted imports of `react-native` without having to install
all the weight of react-native, you can set `react-native` version to `0.0.0`,
and add `@types/react-native` at the latest version.

### Props

All compiler plugins accept the same options:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'config',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      typeSimple: 'enum',

        'Relative path to your tamagui.config.ts file which should export default the result from createTamagui.',
    },
    {
      name: 'components',
      required: false,
      type: 'string[]',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: "['tamagui']",
      description: `Array of npm modules containing Tamagui components which you'll be using in your app. For example:  if you are using the base Tamagui components. This directs the compiler to load and optimize.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'importsWhitelist',
      required: false,
      type: 'string[]',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      description: `Array of whitelisted file paths (always end in .js) which the compiler may try and import and parse at build-time. It is normalized to ".js" ending for all file extensions (js, jsx, tsx, ts). This usually should be set to something like ['constants.js', 'colors.js'] for example, where you have a couple mostly static files of constants that are used as default values for styles.`,
    },

    {

      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: 'false',

      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',

    },
    {

      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',

    },
    {
      name: 'enableDynamicEvaluation',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: 'false',
      description:
        '(Experimental) Enables further extracting of any styled component, even if not in your components. See below for more information.',
    },
    {
      name: 'experimentalFlattenThemesOnNative',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      typeSimple: 'enum',
      default: 'false',
      description:
        '(Experimental) Enables further extracting of components that use theme values on native.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Dynamic Evaluation

By default the Tamagui compiler only optimizes `styled` expressions found in the
modules defined by your `components` config. This means if you do an inline
`styled()` inside your actual app directory, it will default to runtime style
insertion.

This is typically Good Enough™️. As long as you define most of your common
components there, you'll get a very high hit rate of compiled styles being used
and runtime generation being skipped, as atomic styles with your design system
tokens will be mostly pre-generated.

Tamagui has _experimental_ support for loading any component, even if it occurs
somewhere outside your configured components modules. This is called "dynamic
loading", for now. You can enable it with the setting `enableDynamicEvaluation`
as seen above in the props table.

The way it works is, when the compiler detects a styled() expression outside one
of the defined component directories, it will run the following:

1. First, read the file and use a custom `babel` transform to _force_ all
   top-level variables to be exported.
2. Then, run `esbuild` and bundle the entire file to a temporary file in the
   same directory, something like `.tamagui-dynamic-eval-ComponentName.js`
3. Now, read the file in and load all new definitions found.
4. Finally, continue with optimization, using the newly optimized component.

You may see why this is experimental. It's very convenient as a developer, but
has a variety of edge cases that can be confusing or breaking, and we want to
avoid installation woes. Though it does continue on error and work generally, it
outputs warnings in Webpack currently due to our plugin not properly indicating
to Webpack about the new files (a fixable bug), which causes big yellow warning
output and a cache de-opt.

We're leaving this feature under the environment variable while it matures. Let
us know if you find it useful.

### Disabling the compiler

You can disable the compiler optimizations for an entire file with a comment at
the top of your file:

```tsx
// tamagui-ignore
```

You can disable the compiler optimization for a single component with the
boolean property `disableOptimization`:

```tsx
import { View } from '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <View disableOptimization />
)
```
