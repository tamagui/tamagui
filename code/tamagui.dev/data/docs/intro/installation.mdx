<IntroParagraph>
  Setting up Tamagui can be easy, or take a bit of investment. We highly
  recommend starting with our starter templates and preset config.
</IntroParagraph>

Use `npm create tamagui@latest` to pick one of our starter templates.

To install from scratch:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/core
```

Core is just the style library. If you plan to use our full UI kit, you can
avoid installing `@tamagui/core` and instead:

```bash
yarn add tamagui
```

The `tamagui` package is a superset of core, so anywhere the docs reference
`@tamagui/core`, you can replace it with `tamagui`.

Next, you'll want to set up your [configuration](/docs/core/configuration) and
provide it with `TamaguiProvider`:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider, View } from '@tamagui/core'
import config from './tamagui.config' // your configuration

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      <View width={200} height={200} backgroundColor="$background" />
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

We have a recommended preset configuration called `@tamagui/config`:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/config
```

You can use it like so:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider, createTamagui } from '@tamagui/core'
import { defaultConfig } from '@tamagui/config/v4'

// you usually export this from a tamagui.config.ts file
const config = createTamagui(defaultConfig)

type Conf = typeof config

// make imports typed
declare module '@tamagui/core' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default () => {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>{/* your app here */}</TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

And that's it!

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button theme="blue">Hello world</Button>
}
```

From here, we recommend
[spending some time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration).

100% of Tamagui features work at both runtime and compile-time, which makes it
both easy to use and fast. Because it works fully at runtime, and because we've
invested a lot into building it such that it doesn't need any special bundler
configuration to work on either native or web, you can begin using Tamagui with
just the above setup.

Later on, you can [set up the compiler](/docs/intro/compiler-install) to gain
more performance and some nice development helpers.

## Guides

Tamagui generally doesn't require any special bundler setup as we've worked hard
to make it "just work" without configuration in a wide variety of environments.

That said, the broader React Native and React Native Web ecosystem is filled
with packages that do need configuration. Tamagui provides a variety of bundler
plugins that help with that:
