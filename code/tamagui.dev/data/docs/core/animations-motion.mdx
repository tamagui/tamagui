<Notice theme="green">
  **Recommended for dynamic web animations.** Motion is our recommended choice for web-only apps that want buttery smooth, playful animations. For load-time sensitive pages like landing pages, consider using [CSS animations](/docs/core/animations-css) to avoid the JS bundle, or [combine both drivers](/docs/core/animations#combining-drivers).
</Notice>

<Notice theme="blue">
  **Cross-platform note:** If you're using Reanimated on native, use the [Moti driver](/docs/core/animations-reanimated) on web instead of Motion. Otherwise you'll ship both animation libraries, adding significant bundle size.
</Notice>

[Motion](https://motion.dev) is a modern animation library built on the Web Animations API (WAAPI). It features a unique hybrid engine that combines JavaScript animations with native browser APIs to deliver high-performance, GPU-accelerated animations.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-motion motion
```

## Configuration

Add your animations to your [Tamagui config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    '75ms': { duration: 75 },
    '100ms': { duration: 100 },
    '200ms': { duration: 200 },
    superBouncy: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 5,
      mass: 0.7,
      stiffness: 200,
    },
    bouncy: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 9,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 150,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 15,
      stiffness: 120,
      mass: 1,
    },
    quick: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

## How it Works

The Motion driver achieves excellent performance through several key architectural decisions:

### Avoiding React Re-renders

Motion directly mutates the DOM during animations through Motion's `useAnimate` hook, bypassing React's render cycle entirely. This means your animations run at 60fps even while React is busy with other updates.

### Intelligent Diffing

The driver tracks previous animated styles and only sends changed properties to Motion. This minimizes work on each animation frame and reduces overhead.

### Off-Thread Animations

The driver leverages the Web Animations API (WAAPI) which runs animations on the compositor thread when possible. This keeps animations smooth even when the main JavaScript thread is busy - making it ideal for complex interactive components like sheets, popovers, and page transitions.

## Animation Configuration

Motion animations support both spring and tween (timing) animations:

### Spring Animations

```tsx
{
  type: 'spring',
  damping: 10,     // Higher = less bouncy
  mass: 0.9,       // Higher = more inertia
  stiffness: 100,  // Higher = faster
}
```

### Tween Animations

```tsx
{
  duration: 200,   // Duration in milliseconds
}
```

### Delay

You can add animation delays using the array syntax:

```tsx
<Square transition={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

The delay is specified in milliseconds and is converted to seconds for Motion internally.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Engine

Motion is the only animation library with a hybrid engine that can dynamically run animations either via `requestAnimationFrame` or the Web Animations API. This allows it to animate any value while retaining the ability to run animations with hardware acceleration on the GPU.

### WAAPI Performance

The Web Animations API runs animations on the compositor thread when possible, keeping animations smooth even when the main thread is busy. This provides off-thread performance comparable to Reanimated, but for web-only applications.

### Excellent Spring Physics

Motion provides natural, physics-based spring animations with intuitive controls via `damping`, `stiffness`, and `mass` parameters. The spring implementation is excellent and feels very natural.

### Independent Transform Animations

Unlike standard WAAPI, Motion allows you to animate individual transform properties like `x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotate` separately with different animation configurations.

### Lightweight

Motion comes in two sizes - mini (2.3kb) for basic WAAPI animations, and hybrid (17kb) for full featured animations. The Tamagui integration uses the hybrid engine for maximum flexibility - still much smaller than Reanimated.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

For cross-platform apps, use Motion on web and Reanimated on native:

```tsx
// animations.ts (web)
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

```tsx
// animations.native.ts
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

Then import without the extension:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'
```

Your bundler will automatically pick the right file based on the platform.

## Example

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'
import { YStack, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 9,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 150,
  },
  quick: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    mass: 1.2,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
  '100ms': {
    duration: 100,
  },
})

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  // ... rest of config
})

// Usage in components
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <YStack
    transition="bouncy"
    hoverStyle={{
      scale: 1.05,
    }}
    enterStyle={{
      opacity: 0,
      y: 10,
    }}
  />
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Independent Transforms

Motion allows you to animate transform properties independently:

```tsx
<YStack
  transition={{
    x: 'quick',      // Animate x with quick spring
    y: 'bouncy',     // Animate y with bouncy spring
    scale: '100ms',  // Animate scale with 100ms tween
  }}
/>
```

### GPU Acceleration

Motion automatically uses GPU acceleration for transforms and opacity, ensuring smooth 60fps animations even during heavy JavaScript execution.
