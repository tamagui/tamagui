---

[Motion](https://motion.dev) is a modern animation library built on the Web Animations API (WAAPI). It features a unique hybrid engine that combines JavaScript animations with native browser APIs to deliver high-performance, GPU-accelerated animations.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-motion motion
```

## Configuration

Add your animations to your [Tamagui config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    '75ms': { duration: 75 },
    '100ms': { duration: 100 },
    '200ms': { duration: 200 },
    superBouncy: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 5,
      mass: 0.7,
      stiffness: 200,
    },
    bouncy: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 9,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 150,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 15,
      stiffness: 120,
      mass: 1,
    },
    quick: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

## How it Works

At runtime, the Motion driver uses the `useAnimate()` hook from the Motion library to create animation scopes and orchestrate animations. It intelligently batches style changes and only animates properties that have changed, optimizing performance.

The driver leverages the Web Animations API (WAAPI) which runs animations on the compositor thread when possible, keeping animations smooth even when the main thread is busy.

## Animation Configuration

Motion animations support both spring and tween (timing) animations:

### Spring Animations

```tsx
{
  type: 'spring',
  damping: 10,     // Higher = less bouncy
  mass: 0.9,       // Higher = more inertia
  stiffness: 100,  // Higher = faster
}
```

### Tween Animations

```tsx
{
  duration: 200,   // Duration in milliseconds
}
```

### Delay

You can add animation delays using the array syntax:

```tsx
<Square transition={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

The delay is specified in milliseconds and is converted to seconds for Motion internally.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Engine

Motion is the only animation library with a hybrid engine that can dynamically run animations either via `requestAnimationFrame` or the Web Animations API. This allows it to animate any value while retaining the ability to run animations with hardware acceleration on the GPU.

### WAAPI Performance

The Web Animations API runs animations on the compositor thread when possible, keeping animations smooth even when the main thread is busy. This provides off-thread performance comparable to Reanimated, but for web-only applications.

### Excellent Spring Physics

Motion provides natural, physics-based spring animations with intuitive controls via `damping`, `stiffness`, and `mass` parameters. The spring implementation is excellent and feels very natural.

### Independent Transform Animations

Unlike standard WAAPI, Motion allows you to animate individual transform properties like `x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotate` separately with different animation configurations.

### Lightweight

Motion comes in two sizes - mini (2.3kb) for basic WAAPI animations, and hybrid (17kb) for full featured animations. The Tamagui integration uses the hybrid engine for maximum flexibility - still much smaller than Reanimated.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

For cross-platform apps, use Motion on web and Reanimated on native:

```tsx
// animations.ts (web)
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

```tsx
// animations.native.ts
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

Then import without the extension:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'
```

Your bundler will automatically pick the right file based on the platform.

## Example

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'
import { YStack, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 9,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 150,
  },
  quick: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    mass: 1.2,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
  '100ms': {
    duration: 100,
  },
})

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  // ... rest of config
})

// Usage in components
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <YStack
    transition="bouncy"
    hoverStyle={{
      scale: 1.05,
    }}
    enterStyle={{
      opacity: 0,
      y: 10,
    }}
  />
)
```

## Advanced Features

### GPU Acceleration

Motion automatically uses GPU acceleration for transforms and opacity, ensuring smooth 60fps animations even during heavy JavaScript execution.
