Add animations to Tamagui with an animation driver. See the configuration docs
for more on
[how to set it up, and how to set up different animation drivers per-platform](/docs/core/configuration#animations).

Animation drivers are designed to be swappable, so you can use lightweight CSS
animations or other web-focused animation libraries on the web, while using
larger but more advanced libraries like `reanimated` on native - all without
having to change a line outside of configuration.

## Installation

### CSS

The `@tamagui/animations-css` package works with the tamagui compiler and
runtime to give you simple ways to share typed animations across all your
components.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-css
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: 'ease-in 150ms',
    medium: 'ease-in 300ms',
    slow: 'ease-in 450ms',
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, the plugin does very little except to set the `transition` property
in CSS. At compile-time, the compiler does the same, ensuring you get all the
benefits of prop removal and view flattening even when using animations.

### React Native Animated

[React Native's Animated library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) is the
animation library that comes built into React Native and React Native Web.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-react-native
```

Then add it to your [config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

### Reanimated

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an
animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs
off-thread animations, and provides simple syntax and hooks.

To install it add to your package.json:

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-moti react-native-reanimated
```

Tamagui leverages and appreciates the popular open source library [Moti](https://moti.fyi) for the Reanimated driver as it saved us many lines of complex code.

Add your animations to your [configuration](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over
to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile
time - reanimated must run via JS.

---

Note the keys match between CSS and reanimated, so you can swap them out.

<Notice theme="green">
  The Animated driver in React Native Web can be excluded from your bundle with either the Webpack or Next.js plugins with [`excludeReactNativeWebExports`
  compiler option](#excludeReactNativeWebExports).
</Notice>

### Usage

The `animation` can now accept `slow` as a value. By default, animations will
apply to all animatable styles, a lot like setting `all` in a CSS `transition`.
Let's test this by setting `hoverStyle`:

Here's an example animating `hoverStyle`:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsHoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsHover

```

### The animation props rules

If you add an `animation` prop, you must always keep the prop. If you need the animation to be disabled,
pass false, null or even undefined if it suits you.

The spring-based animation drivers have expensive hooks that would degrate runtime
performance if present on every component. As a workaround, the animation hooks
are called conditionally on whether the animation key is present in the props object.

So, `<Square animation={isActive ? 'bouncy' : null} />` rather than
`<Square {...isActive && { animation: 'bouncy' }} />`.

If you'd like to remove or add an animation prop after a component has already rendered, you'd have
to change the key.

### enterStyle

Setting `enterStyle` styles on any component tell it to start with those styles,
and after mount animate to their flat styles:

<HeroContainer>
  <AnimationsEnterDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsEnter

```

### Granular animations

The `animation` prop accepts a string or a more complex object to customize
animations per-property.

The basic object we'll call an `AnimationConfig`, looks like this:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={{
      // only x and y will apply animations
      x: 'bouncy',
      y: {
        type: 'bouncy',
        overshootClamping: true,
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

Note that values can either map to `AnimationKey` as a string, or to
`{ type: AnimationKey, ...configuration }`

You can set a default value using a two-arity array with the default in the
first position:

```tsx
import { YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <YStack
    animation={[
      // all attributes get "bouncy"
      'bouncy',
      // these are customized
      {
        y: 'slow',
        scale: {
          type: 'fast',
          repeat: 2,
        },
      },
    ]}
  />
)
```

### animateOnly

The `animateOnly` prop will limit your animation config to certain keys. It
accepts an array of strings that correspond to style property names.

## AnimatePresence

### exitStyle

AnimatePresence animates direct children before they unmount. It's inspired by
and forked from [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), but works
with any animation in Tamagui.

To use with `@tamagui/core`, install and import `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
It's already bundled and exported from `tamagui`.

You can use it simply with `enterStyle` + `exitStyle`:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, View } from 'tamagui'

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <View
        key="my-square"
        animation="bouncy"
        backgroundColor="green"
        size={50}
        enterStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: 10,
          scale: 0.9,
        }}
        exitStyle={{
          opacity: 0,
          y: -10,
          scale: 0.9,
        }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

<Notice>
  Note you don't even need to set `opacity` on the base style. Tamagui knows to
  normalize styles like opacity and scale to 1 (and y to 0) if it's not defined
  on the base styles but is defined on `enterStyle` or `exitStyle`.
</Notice>

Wrap one or more tamagui components with AnimatePresence. This component will
animate on enter and exit.

<Notice>
  Animated child components must each have a unique key prop so AnimatePresence
  can track their presence in the tree.
</Notice>

### The `custom` prop

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

AnimatePresence also takes a `custom` property that allows you to update a
variant of the animated child before it runs it's exit animation. This is useful
for animating a child out of the screen before it unmounts in a different
direction, like the example above:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence } from '@tamagui/animate-presence'
import { ArrowLeft, ArrowRight } from '@tamagui/lucide-icons'
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Image, XStack, YStack, styled } from 'tamagui'

const GalleryItem = styled(YStack, {
  zIndex: 1,
  x: 0,
  opacity: 1,
  fullscreen: true,

  variants: {
    // 1 = right, 0 = nowhere, -1 = left
    going: {
      ':number': (going) => ({
        enterStyle: {
          x: going > 0 ? 1000 : -1000,
          opacity: 0,
        },
        exitStyle: {
          zIndex: 0,
          x: going < 0 ? 1000 : -1000,
          opacity: 0,
        },
      }),
    },
  } as const,
})

const photos = [
  'https://picsum.photos/500/300',
  'https://picsum.photos/501/300',
  'https://picsum.photos/502/300',
]

const wrap = (min: number, max: number, v: number) => {
  const rangeSize = max - min
  return ((((v - min) % rangeSize) + rangeSize) % rangeSize) + min
}

export function Demo() {
  const [[page, going], setPage] = useState([0, 0])

  const imageIndex = wrap(0, photos.length, page)
  const paginate = (going: number) => {
    setPage([page + going, going])
  }

  return (
    <XStack
      overflow="hidden"
      backgroundColor="#000"
      position="relative"
      height={300}
      width="100%"
      alignItems="center"
    >
      <AnimatePresence initial={false} custom={{ going }}>
        <GalleryItem key={page} animation="slowest" going={going}>
          <Image source={{ uri: photos[imageIndex], width: 500, height: 300 }} />
        </GalleryItem>
      </AnimatePresence>

      <Button
        accessibilityLabel="Carousel left"
        icon={ArrowLeft}
        size="$5"
        position="absolute"
        left="$4"
        circular
        elevate
        onPress={() => paginate(-1)}
        zi={100}
      />
      <Button
        accessibilityLabel="Carousel right"
        icon={ArrowRight}
        size="$5"
        position="absolute"
        right="$4"
        circular
        elevate
        onPress={() => paginate(1)}
        zi={100}
      />
    </XStack>
  )
}
```

### What to know when animating

#### Conditional animations and HMR

The animation hooks are heavy, which initially meant we either had to choose
great performance or animations. We've settled on a trade-off. We track if the
`animation` prop is set, and if so, we enable the hook. If it _is ever set, even
just once_, then the hooks will continue to run for the remainder of the
component lifecycle. This means if you ever plan to animate a component you
should keep `animation` always set on the component props. You can disable it
like so:

```tsx
<View animation={condition ? 'animation-name' : null} />
```

Note that because of this constraint, you also will see an error if you add the
`animation` prop to a component in dev mode during an HMR. Often just saving once more will remove the screen, or reloading at worst.
