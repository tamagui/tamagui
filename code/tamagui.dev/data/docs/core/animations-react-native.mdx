description: Spring-based animations using React Native Animated
---

[React Native's Animated library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) is the
animation library that comes built into React Native and React Native Web.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-react-native
```

## Configuration

Add it to your [Tamagui config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

## Animation Configuration

React Native animations use spring physics with these parameters:

### Spring Parameters

- **`damping`** - Defines how quickly the spring settles. Higher = less bouncy
- **`mass`** - Mass of the object attached to the spring. Higher = more inertia
- **`stiffness`** - Spring stiffness coefficient. Higher = faster animation

```tsx
createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    damping: 10,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
  quick: {
    damping: 20,
    mass: 1.2,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
})
```

### Delay

You can add animation delays using the array syntax:

```tsx
<Square transition={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

The delay is specified in milliseconds and uses `Animated.delay()` internally to sequence animations.

## When to Use

**Advantages:**
- **Cross-platform** - Works on web and React Native
- **Built-in** - No additional animation library needed
- **Spring physics** - Natural, physics-based motion
- **Mature** - Battle-tested in React Native ecosystem

**Limitations:**
- Larger bundle than CSS driver
- Less advanced than Reanimated
- Web-only apps might prefer lighter alternatives

## Platform-Specific Configuration

You can use different drivers on web vs native using platform-specific file extensions:

```tsx
// animations.ts (web)
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-css'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  quick: 'ease-out 150ms',
})
```

```tsx
// animations.native.ts (native)
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  quick: {
    damping: 20,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
})
```

Then import without the extension:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'
```

Your bundler will automatically pick the right file based on the platform.

## Example

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'
import { YStack, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    damping: 10,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
  quick: {
    damping: 20,
    mass: 1.2,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
})

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  // ... rest of config
})

// Usage in components
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <YStack
    transition="bouncy"
    enterStyle={{
      opacity: 0,
      scale: 0.9,
    }}
  />
)
```
