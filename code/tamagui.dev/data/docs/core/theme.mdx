<Notice theme="blue">
  The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`. If you are using `tamagui`, be sure to
  import Theme from there - there's no need to add core to your package.json.
</Notice>

Changing themes in Tamagui is as easy as passing their name to the Theme component.

### Usage

Change themes anywhere in your app like so:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    <Button>I'm a dark button</Button>
  </Theme>
)
```

### Sub-themes

There is one special property of themes that's very helpful for what is essentially sub-themes, or tints.

Basically, if you have a base `dark` theme and a `light` theme, you may want to have "tinted" versions of those themes. For example `light_pink` and `dark_pink`. Instead of having hard-coded color values like `$pink3`, you create as many pink themes as you want: `light_pink_alt1`, `light_pink_alt2`, etc.

Each of those themes is recommended to be small: just having values that map to ViewStyle or TextStyle, like `$color` (and that can postfix pseudo states, like `$colorHover`).

Then, you just give your component a `theme="pink"` prop, or wrap it in `<Theme name="pink" />`. Note you can leave out the `light_` or even `light_pink` prefix, Tamagui will nest properly so long as the parent is set.

It's easier to understand with an example. First, define your tokens and themes:

```tsx
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    pinkDark: '#610c62',
    pinkLight: '#f17efc',
  },
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      background: '#000',
      color: '#fff',
    },
    light: {
      color: '#000',
      background: '#fff',
    },
    dark_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkDark,
      color: tokens.color.pinkLight,
    },
    light_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkLight,
      color: tokens.color.pinkDark,
    },
  },
})
```

Using the `_pink` suffix, the `Theme` component will now let us automatically do sub-theming:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui'

export default () => {
  return (
    <Theme name="dark">
      <Button>I have the theme dark</Button>
      <Theme name="pink">
        <Button>I have the theme pink-dark</Button>
      </Theme>
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

Notice we just use the name `pink`. Because theres no `pink` theme, the Theme component will automatically check if theres a theme that matches the pattern `[currentThemeName]_[givenName]`, in this case `dark_pink`. This is really useful for things like having an `active` or `error` theme that match your parent theme styles.

## Accent (Contrasting Theme)

The `accent` sub-theme provides contrasting colors - use it when you need elements to stand out against the current theme. It works with all color themes:

<HeroContainer>
  <ThemeInverseDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=ThemeInverse

```

### Usage

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <Theme name="light">
    <Button>Light Button</Button>

    <Theme name="accent">
      <Button>Contrasting Button (dark-ish)</Button>
    </Theme>

    <Theme name="red">
      <Theme name="accent">
        <Button>Red + Accent</Button>
      </Theme>
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
)
```

### What themes are created

The `accent` sub-theme creates these theme combinations:

- `light_accent`, `dark_accent` - base contrasting themes
- `light_red_accent`, `light_blue_accent`, etc. - color + contrasting themes

### Important notes

- `accent` must be the **last** (innermost) theme in your nesting
- You cannot nest themes like `<Theme name="accent"><Theme name="red">` - this won't work
- The correct order is always: base → color → accent

```tsx
// ✅ Correct - accent is last
<Theme name="red">
  <Theme name="accent">
    <Button />
  </Theme>
</Theme>

// ❌ Wrong - accent is not last
<Theme name="accent">
  <Theme name="red">
    <Button />
  </Theme>
</Theme>
```

### Using tokens in accent themes

When inside an accent theme, use `$color` tokens - they automatically adapt to the inverted palette:

```tsx
// ✅ Correct - use $color tokens inside accent theme
<View theme="accent" bg="$background">
  <Text color="$color12">This text has proper contrast</Text>
</View>

// $background → dark (inverted from light)
// $color12 → light text (for contrast on dark background)
```

Most Tamagui components (Button, Card, etc.) use `$color` tokens internally, so simply adding `theme="accent"` will give you the correct contrasting appearance.

```tsx
// Components automatically use $color tokens
<Button theme="accent">Contrasting Button</Button>

// For custom styling, use $color tokens
<View theme="accent" bg="$color3" borderColor="$color6">
  <Text color="$color12">Custom styled content</Text>
</View>
```

## Reset

The `reset` prop will change the theme to the grandparent's value:

```tsx
<Theme name="dark">
  <Theme name="pink">
    <Theme reset>
      {/* This square and all children will have theme "dark" */}
      <Square bg="$background" size={10} />
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
</Theme>
```

## themeable()

The `themeable` helper function is a "higher order component" that wraps any React component definition and adds the `theme` prop for changing the theme on that component and its children.

It's used for example on [Button](/docs/components/button).

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

// Using theme prop to apply accent theme to a button
<Button theme="accent">Contrasting Button</Button>

// Or with color themes
<Button theme="red">Red Button</Button>
```
