<Notice theme="blue">
  The package `tamagui` is a superset of `@tamagui/core`. If you are using `tamagui`, be sure to
  import Theme from there - there's no need to add core to your package.json.
</Notice>

Changing themes in Tamagui is as easy as passing their name to the Theme component.

### Usage

Change themes anywhere in your app like so:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    <Button>I'm a dark button</Button>
  </Theme>
)
```

### Sub-themes

There is one special property of themes that's very helpful for what is essentially sub-themes, or tints.

Basically, if you have a base `dark` theme and a `light` theme, you may want to have "tinted" versions of those themes. For example `light_pink` and `dark_pink`. Instead of having hard-coded color values like `$pink3`, you create as many pink themes as you want: `light_pink_alt1`, `light_pink_alt2`, etc.

Each of those themes is recommended to be small: just having values that map to ViewStyle or TextStyle, like `$color` (and that can postfix pseudo states, like `$colorHover`).

Then, you just give your component a `theme="pink"` prop, or wrap it in `<Theme name="pink" />`. Note you can leave out the `light_` or even `light_pink` prefix, Tamagui will nest properly so long as the parent is set.

It's easier to understand with an example. First, define your tokens and themes:

```tsx
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    pinkDark: '#610c62',
    pinkLight: '#f17efc',
  },
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      background: '#000',
      color: '#fff',
    },
    light: {
      color: '#000',
      background: '#fff',
    },
    dark_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkDark,
      color: tokens.color.pinkLight,
    },
    light_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkLight,
      color: tokens.color.pinkDark,
    },
  },
})
```

Using the `_pink` suffix, the `Theme` component will now let us automatically do sub-theming:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui'

export default () => {
  return (
    <Theme name="dark">
      <Button>I have the theme dark</Button>
      <Theme name="pink">
        <Button>I have the theme pink-dark</Button>
      </Theme>
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

Notice we just use the name `pink`. Because theres no `pink` theme, the Theme component will automatically check if theres a theme that matches the pattern `[currentThemeName]_[givenName]`, in this case `dark_pink`. This is really useful for things like having an `active` or `error` theme that match your parent theme styles.

## Inverse

The `inverse` prop will change any dark theme to light, and vice-versa. If it's a sub-theme, it'll check for matching parents, so `dark_red` will inverse to `light_red` if possible:

<HeroContainer>
  <ThemeInverseDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```tsx hero template=ThemeInverse

```

## Reset

The `reset` prop will change the theme to the grandparent's value:

```tsx
<Theme name="dark">
  <Theme name="pink">
    <Theme reset>
      {/* This square and all children will have theme "dark" */}
      <Square bg="$background" size={10} />
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
</Theme>
```

---

## themeable()

The `themeable` helper function is a "higher order component" that wraps any React component definition and adds two props:

- `theme` for changing the theme on that component and its children
- `themeInverse` which wraps the component with `<Theme inverse>`

It's used for example on [Button](/docs/components/button).
