Changing themes in Tamagui is as easy as passing their name to the Theme
component.

## Usage

Change themes anywhere in your app like so:

```tsx
import { Square, Theme } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    <Button>I'm a dark button</Button>
    <Button theme="subtle">I'm using dark_subtle theme</Button>
  </Theme>
)
```

## Defining Themes

Themes live one level below tokens. Tokens are your static variables, where
themes are more dynamic like CSS variables.

You can define themes however you want, but for the `tamagui` UI kit, the
components default styling will use a set of pre-defined keys. Those keys are:

- `background`, `backgroundHover`,`backgroundPress`, `backgroundFocus`
- `borderColor`, `borderColorHover`,`borderColorPress`, `borderColorFocus`
- `shadowColor`

These are optional, as you can always set `unstyled` on any Tamagui component to
use your own styles.

Here's a simplified theme definition:

```tsx
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    pinkDark: '#610c62',
    pinkLight: '#f17efc',
  },
  // ... see configuration docs for required tokens
})

export default createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      background: '#000',
      color: '#fff',
    },
    light: {
      color: '#000',
      background: '#fff',
    },
    dark_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkDark,
      color: tokens.color.pinkLight,
    },
    light_pink: {
      background: tokens.color.pinkLight,
      color: tokens.color.pinkDark,
    },
  },
})
```

Passing tokens to themes will reduce CSS, but is not required.

You can then access theme values for any style value, either through styled() or
through a Styled Component like View or Text:

```tsx
const P = styled(Text, {
  color: '$color12'
})

// or directly
<Text color="$color11" />
```

Because we defined sub-themes `light_pink` and `dark_pink`, the `Theme`
component will now let us do this:

```tsx
import { Button, Theme } from 'tamagui'

export default () => {
  return (
    <Theme name="dark">
      <Button>I have the theme dark</Button>
      <Theme name="pink">
        <Button>I have the theme dark_pink</Button>
      </Theme>
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

Notice we just use the name `pink`, easy!

For more on themes see our [advanced theme guide](/docs/guides/theme-builder)
which also introduces the `createThemes` and `createThemeBuilder`, both of which
help generate larger and richer, typed themes more easily.
