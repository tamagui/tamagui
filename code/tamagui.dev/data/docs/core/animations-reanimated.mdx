description: Advanced off-thread animations with Reanimated and Moti
---

[Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) is an
animation library that targets React Native and React Native Web. It runs
off-thread animations, and provides simple syntax and hooks.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @tamagui/animations-moti moti react-native-reanimated
```

Tamagui leverages and appreciates the popular open source library [Moti](https://moti.fyi) for the Reanimated driver as it saved us many lines of complex code.

Follow the [Reanimated installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/) to complete setup for your platform.

## Configuration

Add your animations to your [Tamagui config](/docs/core/configuration):

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export default createTamagui({
  animations: createAnimations({
    fast: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      mass: 1.2,
      stiffness: 250,
    },
    medium: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 10,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 100,
    },
    slow: {
      type: 'spring',
      damping: 20,
      stiffness: 60,
    },
  }),
  // ...
})
```

## How it Works

At runtime, this plugin parses animatable style properties and hands them over
to reanimated off-thread, using worklets. It doesn't do anything at compile
time - reanimated must run via JS.

## Animation Configuration

Reanimated animations support both spring and timing (tween) animations:

### Spring Animations

```tsx
{
  type: 'spring',
  damping: 10,     // Higher = less bouncy
  mass: 0.9,       // Higher = more inertia
  stiffness: 100,  // Higher = faster
}
```

### Timing Animations

```tsx
{
  type: 'timing',
  duration: 300,   // Duration in milliseconds
}
```

### Delay

You can add animation delays using the array syntax:

```tsx
<Square animation={['bouncy', { delay: 200 }]} />
```

The delay is specified in milliseconds and is passed directly to Moti's animation configuration.

## When to Use

**Advantages:**
- **Off-thread animations** - Runs on UI thread for 60fps performance
- **Cross-platform** - Works on web and React Native
- **Advanced features** - Worklets, gesture integration, shared values
- **React Native optimized** - Best performance on native platforms
- **Powerful** - Most feature-rich animation driver

**Considerations:**
- Larger bundle size
- Requires Reanimated setup and configuration
- More complex than simpler drivers
- Web-only apps might prefer Motion or CSS drivers

## Platform-Specific Configuration

You can use Reanimated on native and a lighter driver on web:

```tsx
// animations.native.ts
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

```tsx
// animations.ts (web)
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-motion'

export const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
})
```

Then import without the extension:

```tsx
import { animations } from './animations'
```

## Example

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-moti'
import { YStack, createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

const animations = createAnimations({
  bouncy: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 10,
    mass: 0.9,
    stiffness: 100,
  },
  quick: {
    type: 'spring',
    damping: 20,
    mass: 1.2,
    stiffness: 250,
  },
})

export default createTamagui({
  animations,
  // ... rest of config
})

// Usage in components
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <YStack
    animation="bouncy"
    enterStyle={{
      opacity: 0,
      scale: 0.9,
    }}
  />
)
```

## Advanced Features

Reanimated provides advanced features through Moti:

- **Gesture integration** - Animate based on gesture values
- **Shared values** - Share animated values between components
- **Worklets** - JavaScript functions that run on the UI thread
- **Custom animations** - Full control over animation curves

See the [Moti documentation](https://moti.fyi) and [Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) for more details.
