<IntroParagraph>
  Deceptively innocuous, designing a robust yet flexible API even for a Button
  can be filled with surprising challenges.
</IntroParagraph>

More than just text in a box, buttons need icons, themes, variants, sizes, often
loading indicators and several interactive states, and always a delicate balance
between sub-components' positions, spacing and style.

All of this ideally delivered in a simple API that still allows complete
customization.

Tamagui allows for building a button with "compound components," a concept
popularized by [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/). With the introduction of
`createStyledContext` in version 1.28 this pattern has become especially easy,
so we wrote this guide to show off building more advanced compound component
APIs. While this guide covers a button, this is applicable to many types of UI
components.

So what are compound components? Simply, it's when you have, say, a
`<Button />` that wants children `<Button.Text />` and `<Button.Icon />`.

And why do they exist? Well, we'll explain that and more in this guide.

Keep in mind that this is an advanced use case. Usually you can just grab
Tamagui components off the shelf and use them with inline styles. But sometimes
you need components that want for multiple related children.

<Notice>
  This guide is more of a primer on designing compound components, teaching
  advanced concepts that aren't necessary if you just want to build your app. If
  you just want a simple, ready to use Button, you can use the [Tamagui
  Button](/docs/components/button) itself directly.

### The Final Result

To the point, here is the final code we'll end up with for our Button, ready to
copy and paste right into your app:

```tsx
import { getSize, getSpace } from '@tamagui/get-token'
import {
  GetProps,
  SizeTokens,
  View,
  Text,
  createStyledContext,
  styled,
  useTheme,
  withStaticProperties,
} from '@tamagui/web'
import { cloneElement, useContext } from 'react'

export const ButtonContext = createStyledContext({
  size: '$md' as SizeTokens,
})

export const ButtonFrame = styled(View, {
  name: 'Button',
  context: ButtonContext,
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'row',

  hoverStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover',
  },

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundPress',
  },

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (name, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          height: tokens.size[name],
          borderRadius: tokens.radius[name],
          // note the getSpace and getSize helpers will let you shift down/up token sizes
          // whereas with gap we just multiply by 0.2
          // this is a stylistic choice, and depends on your design system values
          gap: tokens.space[name].val * 0.2,
          paddingHorizontal: getSpace(name, {
            shift: -1,
          }),
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,

  defaultVariants: {
    size: '$md',
  },
})

type ButtonProps = GetProps<typeof ButtonFrame>

export const ButtonText = styled(Text, {
  name: 'ButtonText',
  context: ButtonContext,
  color: '$color',
  userSelect: 'none',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...fontSize': (name, { font }) => ({
        fontSize: font?.size[name],
      }),
    },
  } as const,
})

const ButtonIcon = (props: { children: any }) => {
  const { size } = useContext(ButtonContext.context)
  const smaller = getSize(size, {
    shift: -2,
  })
  const theme = useTheme()
  return cloneElement(props.children, {
    size: smaller.val * 0.5,
    color: theme.color.get(),
  })
}

export const Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Props: ButtonContext.Provider,
  Text: ButtonText,
  Icon: ButtonIcon,
})
```

Now you can use your button like so:

```tsx
export default () => (
  <Button>
    <Button.Icon>
      <Moon />
    </Button.Icon>
    <Button.Text>hi</Button.Text>
  </Button>
)

// multiple icons:
export default () => (
  <Button>
    <Button.Icon>
      <Moon />
    </Button.Icon>
    <Button.Text>hi</Button.Text>
    <Button.Icon>
      <Moon />
    </Button.Icon>
  </Button>
)
```

This may only be a ~hundred lines of code, but there's a lot to take in. And
behind the scenes, there's a lot going on behind to make this possible.

### From the Start

This guide will build up to this complete example from the ground up, which
should help explain both why many pattern exist, and also how they work.

We start with the assumption that we have a design system set up with a tokens
that use keys `sm`, `md`, and `lg` and a few themes:

```tsx
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from '@tamagui/core'

export default createTamagui({
  tokens: createTokens({
    size: {
      sm: 38,
      md: 46,
      lg: 60,
    },
    space: {
      sm: 15,
      md: 20,
      lg: 25,
    },
    radius: {
      sm: 4,
      md: 8,
      lg: 12,
    },
    // ... the rest of your tokens
  }),

  themes: {
    light: {
      background: '#fff',
      color: '#000',
    },

    // define a Button sub-theme, see the Themes docs for more
    light_Button: {
      background: '#ccc',
      backgroundPress: '#bbb', // darker background on press
      backgroundHover: '#ddd', // lighter background on hover
      color: '#222'
    },
  },

  // ... the rest of your tamagui.config.ts
})
```

If you'd like to see a more complete work-up of a Tamagui config, check out
[the Simple Web starter repo source code](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/starters/simple-web/src/tamagui.config.ts)
or go ahead and create that starter using `npm create tamagui@latest`.

With that in mind, we can create the outer frame of the button fairly simply,
like so:

```tsx
import { View, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

const ButtonFrame = styled(View, {
  // the name indicates to use the sub-theme `Button`
  // since we defined light_Button, if our theme is light, this component
  // will always use the values from our `light_Button` theme
  name: 'Button',

  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'row',

  // our $ prefixed values look for theme first, then fallback to tokens
  backgroundColor: '$background', // #ccc
  hoverStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover', // #ddd
  },
  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundPress', // #bbb
  },

  // these all use tokens
  // note that size tokens are used only for these properties:
  //   width, height, minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth and maxHeight
  height: '$md', // 46

  // meanwhile our radius token is used here
  borderRadius: '$md', // 8

  // and space tokens are used for all others
  paddingHorizontal: '$sm', // 25
})

```

This gets us a simple rounded rectangle that uses the `md` tokens from your
design system and the `background` styles from your theme.

We set the `name` property to `"Button"`, which tells Tamagui to check for a
sub-theme `Button` that extends the current one. So since we have a theme
`light` and we have a sub-theme `light_Button`, Tamagui find the theme
`light_Button` and apply it to this component, getting the `background` value
from that theme (assuming we have our base theme set to light).

Finally we set the `hoverStyle` and `pressStyle` so our button frame looks nice
when hovered or pressed.

Next we'll want a Text component to go inside:

```tsx
import { Text, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

export const ButtonText = styled(Text, {
  name: 'ButtonText',
  color: '$color',
  fontFamily: '$body',
  fontSize: '$md',
  lineHeight: '$md',
  userSelect: 'none',
})
```

This is pretty similar to the frame, just with its own name and with a `color`
set rather than a `background`. Since we didn't define a `light_ButtonText`
theme, this will fall back to the color defined on the light theme. Finally,
button text usually isn't selectable so we set `userSelect` to none.

We can use our simple button. It's nicely themed, but only renders at one size:

```tsx
export default () => (
  <Button>
    <ButtonText>
      Hello world
    </ButtonText>
  </Button>
)
```

So we'll make it sizeable. First, let's look at how we'd solve this without the
new `createStyledContext` helper, so we can understand why it exists.

We can add some variants:

```tsx
const ButtonFrame = styled(View, {
  name: 'Button',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'row',

  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        height: '$sm',
        borderRadius: '$sm',
        gap: 4,
      },
      md: {
        height: '$md',
        borderRadius: '$md',
        gap: 6,
      },
      lg: {
        height: '$lg',
        borderRadius: '$lg',
        gap: 8,
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

```

Still, this is somewhat repetitive and prone to mistakes via typo. To allow us
to avoid duplication while also always working even if we add a new sizes to our
design system in the future, we can use the handy Tamagui
[Spread Variants](/docs/core/variants#spread-variants):

```tsx
import { View, styled } from '@tamagui/core'

const ButtonFrame = styled(View, {
  name: 'Button',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'row',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (name, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          height: tokens.size[name],
          borderRadius: tokens.radius[name],
          gap: tokens.space[name].val * 0.2,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

export const ButtonText = styled(Text, {
  name: 'ButtonText',
  color: '$color',
  userSelect: 'none',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...fontSize': (name, { font }) => ({
        fontSize: font?.size[name],
      }),
    },
  } as const,
})
```

<Notice>
The `...size` spread variant `name` defaults to implicit any. Update `tsconfig.json`'s `"noImplicitAny": false` to avoid TypeScript errors.
</Notice>



So now we can pass in our new `size` property:

```tsx
<ButtonFrame size="$md">
  <ButtonText size="$md" />
</ButtonFrame>
```

Lets just clean up these two components so they are more clearly meant to be
used together (and are easier to import for users):

```tsx
export const Button = ButtonFrame as typeof ButtonFrame & {
  Text: typeof ButtonText
}

Button.Text = Text
```

What is this whole `typeof ButtonFrame` thing? It's just TypeScript being
awkward. Since Tamagui uses this pattern internally for many components, we've
made a small helper:

```tsx
import { withStaticProperties } from '@tamagui/core'

export const Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Text: ButtonText,
})
```

Which is functionally the same as the above. So, now our users can do:

```tsx
import { Button } from './OurButton'

export default () => (
  <Button size="$md">
    <Button.Text size="$md">Hello world</Button.Text>
  </Button>
)
```

### Improving the API

Great. We've gotten our custom Button exported. But there's something quite
unfortunate about our API as it stands, and that is that we have to always pass
`size` to both components. This is brittle and ugly.

One typical way to solve this would be to abstract both of these components into
our own React component:

```tsx
const Button = ({
  size,
  children,
  textProps,
  ...props
}: ViewProps & {
  textProps?: TextProps
}) => (
  <ButtonFrame size={size} {...props}>
    <ButtonText size={size} {...textProps}>
      {children}
    </ButtonText>
  </ButtonFrame>
)
```

But suddenly we have issues. What if a user wants to show an icon? We need to
add `icon` and `iconProps`. And what if they want to change the order? You may
reach for something like `direction="reverse"`. But then what if they want a
loading indicator after, but an icon before. Or maybe they want to show big text
above, and smaller text below.

The problem with abstracting your Button into a single component is that the
internals are surprisingly flexible, and ideally they want to each be styled
independently.

Abstracting the tree structure that's output is our problem. The compound
component API gives us full control - we can customize every piece, even using
the existing `styled` function to re-style each piece, before re-exporting it
again:

```tsx
import { withStaticProperties } from '@tamagui/core'

import { Button } from './OurButton'

const CustomButtonFrame = styled(Button, {
  // override some styles
})

const CustomButtonText = styled(Button.Text, {
  // override some styles
})

export const CustomButton = withStaticProperties(CustomButtonFrame, {
  Text: CustomButtonText,
})

export default () => (
  <CustomButton>
    <CustomButton.Text>Hello world</CustomButton.Text>
    <CustomButton.Text size="$sm">(Smaller text)</CustomButton.Text>
  </CustomButton>
)
```

Not to mention by staying with the `styled` world, the Tamagui optimizing
compiler confidently flattens our Button components down to ridiculously fast
DOM output on the web, and pulls out all styles from the render loop on native.

So we want our compound component API both for ergonomics and for performance,
but we need some way to thread our `size` property down from the parent frame to
the inner sub-components.

### Solving size

In React this is typically what context is used for.

Here's how we'd solve for size using context in plain-old React, while still
keeping the compound API:

```tsx
import { createContext } from 'react'
import { SizeTokens, GetProps, withStaticProperties } from '@tamagui/core'
import { Button } from './OurButton'

const SizeContext = createContext<SizeTokens>('$md')

const ButtonFrame = Button.styleable(
  ({ size = '$md', ...props }: GetProps<typeof OGB.ButtonFrame>) => {
    return (
      <SizeContext.Provider value={size}>
        <Button size={size} {...props} />
      </SizeContext.Provider>
    )
  },
)

const ButtonText = Button.Text.styleable(
  (props: GetProps<typeof OGB.ButtonText>) => {
    const size = useContext(SizeContext)
    return <Button.Text size={size} {...props} />
  },
)

export const NewButton = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Text: ButtonText,
})
```

What the hell is `ButtonText.styleable` and `ButtonFrame.styleable`?

Well, while it's explained in [the styled docs](/docs/core/styled#styleable) but
the short of it is if you want a functional component that returns a styled
component _to then be able to be styled again_, well, you need `styleable`.

That's because merging things like themes, animations, variants, media queries,
and pseudo queries is quite complex, and if Tamagui doesn't know that there is a
functional component in between some styled components it can lead to unexpected
merging of styles.

More importantly, the above code is once again verbose, duplicative, and
brittle. For example sharing more than just `size` across these components would
require a pretty significant refactor of the context with a lot of logic
memoizing the context value properly. And, once again, by moving into functional
components, your base level views now won't be as optimized by the compiler.

### The solution, createStyledContext

Finally we get to use `createStyledContext`. We just change from `createContext`
to:

```tsx
import { createStyledContext } from '@tamagui/core'

export const ButtonContext = createStyledContext({
  size: '$md' as SizeTokens,
})
```

This in fact it returns a slightly modified `React.Context` just like
`createContext` does, so you can use it with `useContext` later on - though we
still export a `.context` object with the original type just in case there's any
issue.

And now, bringing back the full example, we add an extra property to each
`styled` component, `context`:

```tsx
import { View, styled, createStyledContext } from '@tamagui/core'

export const ButtonContext = createStyledContext({
  size: '$md' as SizeTokens,
})

const ButtonFrame = styled(View, {
  name: 'Button',
  context: ButtonContext,
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  alignItems: 'center',
  flexDirection: 'row',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (name, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          height: tokens.size[name],
          borderRadius: tokens.radius[name],
          gap: tokens.space[name].val * 0.2,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

const ButtonText = styled(Text, {
  name: 'ButtonText',
  context: ButtonContext,
  color: '$color',
  userSelect: 'none',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...fontSize': (name, { font }) => ({
        fontSize: font?.size[name],
      }),
    },
  } as const,
})

export const Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Text: ButtonText,
  Props: ButtonContext.Provider,
})
```

...and we've finally arrived at our destination! We can now do the following:

```tsx
import { Button } from './OurButton'

export default () => (
  <Button size="$md">
    <Button.Text>
      Hello world
    </Button.Text>
  </Button>
)
```

This time since `Button` knows the `size` property is defined in the `context`
it will automatically pass size down from Button to Text, just like our
hand-rolled version did.

But - we don't have to write terribly verbose and brittle code, we get nice
types and memoization automatically, and the optimizing compiler is happy.

Notice we also exported a new property on Button, `Button.Props`.

Since `createStyledContext` returns a regular `React.Context` value, this works
the same as any other React provider. We can now control the variant from
anywhere above in the React tree:

```tsx
import { Button } from './OurButton'

export default () => (
  <Button.Props size="$md">
    <Button>
      <Button.Text>
        Hello world
      </Button.Text>
    </Button>
  </Button.Props>
)
```

The only difference from `createContext` is that the `createStyledContext`
Provider just takes props directly rather than inside a `value` object (and of
course the memoization comes for free).

### Adding an Icon

Are we done?

Not quite. One final common piece of a Button is having an icon that sizes and
colors properly as well. But an icon usually comes from some third-party
library, an SVG or perhaps an icon font.

Let's add a new component, `Button.Icon` and make this work.

Instead of going through `styled`, this component will be just a plain
functional component. It will still work nicely with the Tamagui themes and
sizes, showing how you can use them together with external React components.

```tsx
import { getTokens, useTheme } from '@tamagui/core'
import * as React from 'react'

const ButtonIcon = (props: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const { size } = React.useContext(ButtonContext)
  const tokens = getTokens()
  const smallerSize = tokens.size[size].val * 0.5
  const theme = useTheme()
  return React.cloneElement(props.children, {
    width: smallerSize,
    height: smallerSize,
    color: theme.color.get(),
  })
}

// add it to your Button:

export const Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {
  Text: ButtonText,
  Icon: ButtonIcon,
  Props: ButtonContext.Provider,
})
```

Now we can use it like this, assuming your Icon accepts `width`, `height`, and
`color`:

```tsx
import { MyIcon } from 'some-icon-library'

export default () => (
  <Button size="$lg">
    <Button.Icon>
      <MyIcon />
    </Button.Icon>
    <Button.Text>
      Hello world
    </Button.Text>
  </Button>
)
```

Of course you can make your `Button.Icon` work a bit differently if you'd like,
say changing out `children` + `cloneElement` for something like
`<Button.Icon icon={MyIcon} />`. It's up to you.

### Conclusion

We hope this has been helpful in explaining a variety of Tamagui features and
some of the benefits of and ideas behind compound components.

There's certainly further you can go in building out your Button, but we think
that in under 150 lines of code you're getting a nearly ideal API, fully typed
sizing and themes, and a great balance of customization to performance.

If you are working on a smaller app, say one that shows only a few buttons at a
time or with a small set of button variations, then abstracting your Button into
a single functional Button component is totally fine.

But we'd that encourage you to give the compound component API a try and see
how you like it.

With the new Tamagui APIs, we look forward to never having to carefully add a
forwardRef, re-jig the types, and then manually thread context just to share
some props between parent and child components, especially when even after all
of that we'd still somehow accidentally break memoization or scoped values!
