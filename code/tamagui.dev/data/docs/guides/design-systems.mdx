Tamagui allows you to build our your own set of components that are optimized
with the compiler whenever they are used in your app.

By default, if you just use `styled()` in your app, Tamagui **won't** be able to
optimize those components. This is because the compiler needs to know about
those components at build-time.

Let's break down how to set this up in more detail.

## Step 1: Create a package

Your design system needs to live in it's own npm module, which can be private to
just your app. That way you can later direct the compiler to look for that
package.

Design systems can extend off each other. In fact `tamagui` extends off
`@tamagui/core`, which contains simple base level components.

So, for example, if you'd like to use the Tamagui `XStack`, `YStack`, `Button`
and `Paragraph` in your design system, you would add `tamagui` to your design
system's package.json.

If you want to build more from scratch, then use `@tamagui/core` and only import
either the `View` or `Text` components. For the purpose of this guide, we'll use
`@tamagui/core`.

Add package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "@ourapp/components",
  "types": "./types/index.d.ts",
  "main": "dist/cjs",
  "module": "dist/esm",
  "module:jsx": "dist/jsx",
  "files": ["types", "src", "dist"],
  "sideEffects": ["*.css"],
  "dependencies": {
    "@tamagui/core": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tamagui-build",
    "watch": "tamagui-build --watch"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tamagui/build": "*"
  }
}
```

If using Typescript, a `tsconfig.json` of your choosing:

```
{
  "types": ["node", "react"],
  "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./", // resolve absolute module names from here
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["./**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules/**/*"
  ]
}
```

There are a few things to note here:

- We're using `@tamagui/build` to build this package, which is a small script
  built around `esbuild` and `typescript` that makes sure you output your
  components _with JSX preserved_.
- We then set `module:jsx`, which then needs to be added to your webpack
  `resolve.mainFields`.
  - The Next.js plugin handles this for you automatically.
- `sideEffects` field is important, otherwise webpack will remove the generated
  CSS in production.

## Step 2: Create your design system.

Check the [configuration](/docs/core/configuration) for more detail on this
step.

You'll be creating a `tamagui.config.ts` at the the root of your app. It will
contain a full suite of tokens, themes, and fonts exported onto a single named
`config` export.

## Step 3: Define and export components

Now, create and export the components. You can re-export components from
`tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` as well. Let's create a Circle component

`Circle.tsx`:

```tsx
import { GetProps, YStack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core' if extending just that

export const Circle = styled(YStack, {
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,
  overflow: 'hidden',

  variants: {
    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  },
})

export type CircleProps = GetProps<typeof Circle>
```

And then export from `index.tsx`:

```tsx
export * from './Circle'
```

## Step 4: Set up your build

Now in your app, add `@ourapp/components` and `tamagui` (since we are extending
it) to your package.json, and update your tamagui build configuration.

### Webpack

In your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
{
  loader: 'tamagui-loader',
  options: {
    config: './tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['@ourapp/components', 'tamagui'],
  },
}
```

### Next.js

In your `next.config.js`:

```js
export default withPlugins([
  withTamagui({
    config: './tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['@ourapp/components', 'tamagui'],
  })
])
```

### React Native

In your `babel.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    [
      '@tamagui/babel-plugin',
      {
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        config: './tamagui.config.ts',
        components: ['@ourapp/components', 'tamagui']
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

### Configuration notes

You only need `tamagui` in your `components` array if you extend it, otherwise
no need. You can also extend your own base level module so long as they export
Tamagui `styled` components.

## Step 5: Test it out

In your app, you should now be able to import and use your Circle component.
Using the debug pragma, you can also verify the extraction is working. Make sure
the build settings `logTimings: true` and `disableExtraction: false` are set so
you can see the compiler at work:

Anywhere in your app:

```tsx
import { Circle } from '@ourapp/components'

export default () => <Circle size="$large" />
```

When it compiles you should see something like:

```bash
»                  app.tsx  16ms ׁ·    1 optimized · 1 flattened
```

To get more information on any extraction, use the `// debug` pragma:

```tsx
// debug
// ^ the above pragma will direct Tamagui to output a lot of information on the extraction
import { Circle } from '@ourapp/components'

export default () => <Circle size="$large" />
```

You should see much more log output with details on how it extracted, including
the final CSS and JS.
