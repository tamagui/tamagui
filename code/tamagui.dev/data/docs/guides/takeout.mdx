# Takeout

Takeout is a production-ready starter kit for building real-time, cross-platform applications. It brings together modern tools and patterns refined through building real products, with a focus on developer experience and deployment reliability.

## Versions

### v2 (Recommended)

The latest version of Takeout built on modern technologies:

- **One** - Universal React framework for web and native
- **Zero** - Real-time sync with offline-first architecture
- **Better Auth** - OAuth and email authentication
- **Tamagui** - Universal UI components
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe database schema
- **SST / Uncloud** - Deployment options

### v1 (Legacy)

The original Takeout stack, still supported:

- **Next.js + Expo Router** - Web and native routing
- **Supabase** - Backend and authentication
- **tRPC** - Type-safe APIs
- **Tamagui** - Universal UI components

### v2-free (Open Source)

A free, open-source starter template with limited features. Great for learning and prototyping.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Bun** 1.2+ - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh)
- **Docker** - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (must be running)
- **Git** - For version control

For mobile development:

- **iOS**: macOS with Xcode 15+
- **Android**: Android Studio with JDK 17+

---

## Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun tko onboard
```

The onboarding wizard will guide you through setup. After onboarding, run in separate terminals:

```bash
bun backend      # start docker services (postgres, zero, minio)
bun dev          # start web dev server at http://localhost:8081
```

---

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun dev` | Start web dev server |
| `bun backend` | Start Docker services |
| `bun ios` | Run iOS simulator |
| `bun android` | Run Android emulator |
| `bun tko check` | Run all checks (lint, types, dependencies) |
| `bun tko docs list` | View built-in documentation |
| `bun lint:fix` | Auto-fix linting issues |
| `bun test:unit` | Run unit tests |
| `bun test:integration` | Run integration tests |

---

## CLI Tools

Takeout comes with a CLI (`bun tko`) that provides organized access to scripts and documentation:

```bash
# List available commands
bun tko

# View documentation
bun tko docs list

# Run specific scripts
bun tko check types      # TypeScript checking
bun tko aws health       # AWS health check
```

---

## Deployment

### Uncloud (Self-hosted)

Deploy to any VPS with Docker using a single command:

```bash
bun tko uncloud deploy-prod
```

Features:
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic load balancing
- Built-in service discovery
- Minimal resource footprint

### SST (AWS)

Full serverless deployment to AWS:

```bash
bun tko sst deploy production

## Adding Icons

This project uses [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) for all UI icons:

```bash
# Add a regular icon
bun tko icon/add-phosphor Heart

# Add a different weight (regular, bold, duotone, fill, light, thin)
bun tko icon/add-phosphor User --weight=fill
```

Icons are automatically generated and can be imported:

```tsx
import { HeartIcon } from '~/interface/icons/phosphor/HeartIcon'
```

---

## Database

### Local Development

PostgreSQL runs in Docker on port 5433:

- Main database: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5433/postgres`
- Zero sync databases: `zero_cvr` and `zero_cdb`

### Migrations

Update your schema in `src/database/schema-public.ts` and run:

```bash
bun migrate          # Build and run migrations
bun db:migrate-add   # Create one-off migrations
```
