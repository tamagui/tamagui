## Importing from React Native

In general, either your Webpack configuration or using `@tamagui/next-plugin`,
you will be aliasing `react-native` to `react-native-web`. This means you should
import anything you need from `react-native` directly, and never from
`react-native-web`. Your bundler will handle changing it automatically.

## Classes generated

Tamagui generates a few helpful classes. For components created with `styled()`
where a `name` is set like this:

```tsx
const MyButton = styled(View, {
  name: 'MyButton',
  backgroundColor: 'red',
})
```

Tamagui adds the classname `is_MyButton`. This is a useful escape hatch for
attaching CSS to any extra component. All the default Tamagui components have
their name set.

For component that extends a Text-based component, a further classname is set of
the format `font_[fontFamily]`. So if you do:

```tsx
<Paragraph fontFamily="$body" />
```

The classnames `is_Paragraph` and `font_body` will be output to DOM.

## Debugging

Tamagui has several ways of giving you more insight into what's happening at
compile-time.

### Visualizer

You can setup a simple visualizer that shows a quick heads-up-display when you
hold "Option" (or any key you define) after a short period of time, revealing
the styled components names and even the file numbers and components they are in
(if you have the compiler plugin installed) as an overlay over app in
development mode.

```tsx
import { setupDev } from '@tamagui/core'

setupDev({
  // can just be true as well for defaulting to key: Alt + delay: 800
  visualizer: {
    key: 'Alt',
    delay: 800
  }
})
```

### Debug pragma

To see what's being extracted, why, and every step along the optimization
pipeline, add `// debug` to the top of any file. Adding `// debug-verbose` will
show even more information, including more granular timings.

If you're developing in your design system package that is built with
@tamagui/build, esbuild will strip this banner. You can try using `//! debug`
(esbuild only preserves comments at the top that start with `//!`), but still
occasionally esbuild will insert a helper above the comment, breaking it, so be
sure to check the built file in `dist/jsx`.

### Debug prop

Adding `debug` to any Tamagui component will output a lot of information on
what's going on at runtime. Use it like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default () => <Button debug>Hello world</Button>
```

And you'll see props, styles, and a variety of variables relevant to processing
them.

You can do `<Button debug="break" />` to have it break at the beginning of
rendering, or `<Button debug="verbose" />` to have it output more detailed debug
information.

### DEBUG env

If you set `DEBUG=tamagui` before your build command, you will get the full
debug output of every file built. This is useful for seeing everything that's
happening across every file, and especially helpful for diagnosing production
issues.

## Runtime introspection

In development mode, Tamagui sets the variable `Tamagui` onto `globalThis` with
a lot of helpful internals, including your entire parsed config from
`tamagui.config.ts`.

Beyond your config, you have:

- **allSelectors**: All the selectors inserted by Tamagui (before runtime).

### Inspecting Components

Any `styled()` component will have a `staticConfig` property attached to it:

```tsx
const Circle = styled(View, {
  borderRadius: 1000,
})

console.log(Circle.staticConfig) // lots of helpful information
```

- `componentName` is taken from the `name` key
- `variants` contains the merged variants including parents.
- `defaultProps` is the extracted props left to use as defaults on the
  component.
