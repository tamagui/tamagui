title: Configuration
description: Custom themes, tokens, shorthands, and media queries.
---

Note that you don't have to set up a design system with `createTamagui` at all,
and that we have a variety of helpful presets if you'd like some of the upsides
without having to set it up yourself.

To start, create a `tamagui.config.ts` in the root of your app. It should only
be imported by the top-level file that has all your root providers to ensure no
cycles exist in your imports.

## Quick Start

You can use `@tamagui/config` which provides a complete config out of the box,
the same one this site uses.

```tsx fileName="tamagui.config.ts"
import { config } from '@tamagui/config/v3'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const appConfig = createTamagui(config)

export type AppConfig = typeof appConfig

declare module 'tamagui' {
  // or '@tamagui/core'
  // overrides TamaguiCustomConfig so your custom types
  // work everywhere you import `tamagui`
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default appConfig
```

Then add Inter font to your `index.html` head for web:

```html fileName="index.html"
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

or `App.tsx` if using Expo:

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'

export default function App() {
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    Inter: require('@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Medium.otf'),
    InterBold: require('@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Bold.otf'),
  })

  if (!loaded) {
    return null
  }

  return <>...</>
}
```

<Notice theme="green">
  See `Custom Font Family on Native` under [Font tokens](/docs/core/configuration#font-tokens) for more info on Expo font loading.
</Notice>

Inter fonts for the `body`, `heading`, and `mono` are defined in `@tamagui/config/v3`, so you'll want to load them, but you can also easily change those definitions by defining your own fonts.

You can also import parts of `@tamagui/config/v3` separately, swapping out any
piece for your own. The v3 config defaults to the CSS animation driver on the
web and the built-in Animated driver on React Native.

Throughout this guide keep in mind that you should import from just one "ui"
package - whether it's `@tamagui/core` or `tamagui` or it's your custom one.

#### A gist for custom theme suites

The themes in the config above are specific to the Tamagui site.
We've set up [a themes example gist](https://gist.github.com/natew/3be503cc5990a1142d17ffadf86a134f)
which has a full built-up theme suite which you can pass to `createTamagui({ themes })`. It's large,
so you may want to put it in a `themes.ts` file next to your `tamagui.config.ts` and import it.

## From scratch

Let's start with an example of a complete `tamagui.config.ts`. Note that keys
used here can be customized to your liking, and remember that they combine with
your [shorthands](#shorthands) to give you a syntax like this:

```tsx
<XStack bg="$red" w="$2" h="$1" />
```

```tsx  fileName="tamagui.config.ts"
// @tamagui/core doesn't include `createMedia` so that it can avoid
// a dependency on react-native. If you are using tamagui, you can
// import createMedia from there directly and avoid this line:
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'
import { createFont, createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

// Create a font:

// To work with the tamagui UI kit styled components (which is optional)
// you'd want the keys used for `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight` and
// `letterSpacing` to be consistent. The `createFont` function
// will fill-in any missing values if `lineHeight`, `weight` or
// `letterSpacing` are subsets of `size`.

const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
  },
  lineHeight: {
    // 1 will be 22
    2: 22,
  },
  weight: {
    1: '300',
    // 2 will be 300
    3: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    1: 0,
    2: -1,
    // 3 will be -1
  },
  // (native only) swaps out fonts by face/style
  face: {
    300: { normal: 'InterLight', italic: 'InterItalic' },
    600: { normal: 'InterBold' },
  },
})

// Set up our tokens

// The keys can be whatever you want, but we do recommend keeping them
// consistent across the different token categories and intended for
// usage together to make nice designs - eg for a Button to use.

const size = {
  0: 0,
  1: 5,
  2: 10,
  // ....
}

export const tokens = createTokens({
  size,
  space: { ...size, '-1': -5, '-2': -10 },
  radius: { 0: 0, 1: 3 },
  zIndex: { 0: 0, 1: 100, 2: 200 },
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})

const config = createTamagui({
  fonts: {
    // for tamagui, heading and body are assumed
    heading: interFont,
    body: interFont,
  },
  tokens,

  // For more on themes, see the Themes page
  themes: {
    light: {
      bg: '#f2f2f2',
      color: tokens.color.black,
    },
    dark: {
      bg: '#111',
      color: tokens.color.white,
    },
  },

  // For web-only, media queries work out of the box and you can avoid the
  // `createMedia` call here by passing the media object directly.
  // If you are going to target React Native, use `createMedia` (it's an identity
  // function on web so you can import it there without concern).
  media: createMedia({
    sm: { maxWidth: 860 },
    gtSm: { minWidth: 860 + 1 },
    short: { maxHeight: 820 },
    hoverNone: { hover: 'none' },
    pointerCoarse: { pointer: 'coarse' },
  }),

  // Shorthands
  // Adds <View m={10} /> to <View margin={10} />
  // See Settings section on this page to only allow shorthands
  // Be sure to have `as const` at the end
  shorthands: {
    px: 'paddingHorizontal',
    f: 'flex',
    m: 'margin',
    w: 'width',
  } as const,

  // Change the default props for any styled() component with a name.
  // We are discouraging the use of this and have deprecated it, prefer to use
  // styled() on any component to change it's styles.
  defaultProps: {
    Text: {
      color: 'green'
    },
  },
})

type AppConfig = typeof config

// this will give you types for your components
// note - if using your own design system, put the package name here instead of tamagui
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // if you want types for group styling props, define them like so:
  interface TypeOverride {
    groupNames(): 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
  }
}

export default config
```

The `createTamagui` function receives a configuration object:

- `tokens`: Use `createTokens` to generate variables in your theme and app.
- `theme`: Define your design [theme](/docs/intro/themes), which map to CSS
  properties.
- `media`: Define reusable responsive [media queries](/docs/use-media).
- `shorthands`: Define any props you want to expand to style values, keys being
  the shorthand and values being the expanded style prop.
- `defaultProps`: For more advanced uses, you can override all named `styled()`
  components initial values. These merge downwards, so
  `styled(Text, { name: 'Paragraph' })` will get any defaultProps set for
  `Text`.
- `onlyAllowShorthands`: When set to true will ensure that if you define
  shorthands, they override existing long-form style props.

<Notice>
  On Android you need to set the `face` option in `createFont` or else fonts won't pick up different weights, due to a React Native restriction.
</Notice>

Note, for `tamagui` (not core), it expects you to define a `true` token that
maps to your default size, this way it knows what token to use by default. So
you'd do something like this:

```tsx
export const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    small: 20,
    medium: 30,
    true: 30, // note true = 30 just like medium, your default size token
    large: 40,
  },
  space: {
    small: 10,
    medium: 20,
    true: 20, // same goes for space and other token categories
    large: 30,
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  The compiler will parse your tamagui.config.ts file at build-time. For this reason, we recommend keeping it relatively simple. Don't import heavy dependencies, and prefer to import `createTamagui` and other helpers directly from @tamagui/core. 
</Notice>

### Add Provider

Import and use the Tamagui `Provider` component at the top component in your
app.

```tsx line=3-5 fileName="App.tsx"
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      <AppContents />
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Using Tamagui Provider

TamaguiProvider takes a few optional properties:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'defaultTheme',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      description: `The initial top level theme.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'disableRootThemeClass',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'Disable inserting a theme class in the DOM or context, allowing you to manually place it higher. For custom use cases like integration with next-theme.',
    },
    {
      name: 'disableInjectCSS',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: `By default Tamagui inserts CSS with a useInsertionEffect on load. But if you're setting up SSR you'll want to use getCSS() on the server instead and then turn on this setting.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

If you use `disableInjectCSS`, you'll need to do something like this from the server:

```tsx
<head>
  <style
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: Tamagui.getCSS(),
    }}
  />
</head>
```

<Notice>
  If you are using Next.js, see the [Next.js guide](/docs/guides/next-js?#pages_documenttsx) for more information.
</Notice>

### Including the reset css

There is an optional CSS reset that helps normalize styling, you can import it
into your app like so:

```tsx
import '@tamagui/core/reset.css'
```

<Notice>
  You will have to turn `isCSSEnabled` on if you're using Metro as your web bundler. See [Metro guide](/docs/guides/metro#web-support).
</Notice>

### Setup media query driver

`@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media capabilities out of the box to native
apps, while on the web it uses native media queries. To enable media queries for
React Native, you need to provide matchMedia implementation:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/react-native-media-driver
```

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'

export default createTamagui({
  media: createMedia({
    xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
    // ...
  }),
})
```

##### Optimizing further (Advanced)

```tsx
import Tamagui from './tamagui.config'

const css = Tamagui.getCSS()
// insert into your head
```

Note that you can optimize this a bit by generating your CSS at build-time and
then avoiding generating it on the client. This is covered in the Next.js Guide
as it gives a good example of how to put all the pieces together properly, but
you can apply it to any other framework.

To do this you would do something like this:

```tsx
Tamagui.getCSS({
  // if you are calling getCSS on the server somewhere, you can add this { exclude: 'design-system' }
  // to your *client* side getCSS call to avoid more work and duplicate CSS generation.

  // Note that you call getCSS on both the server and client. This is what you'd write on the client.
  // It will ensure any CSS generated by your first render pass is available.
  exclude: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'design-system' : null,
})
```

For Next.js there's a nice [option to `outputCSS`](/docs/guides/next-js) which
will handle emitting a css file for you. But you can also just do this yourself
by calling Tamagui.getCSS() with any other bundler or framework sometime in your
pre-build or on the server and handing it over as CSS.

One final optimization you can make if you are serving getCSS from the server is
setting the environment variable `TAMAGUI_DOES_SSR_CSS` to `"true"` for the
client bundle only. One gotcha - if you plan on calling `mutateTheme` or
`addTheme` at some point, set `TAMAGUI_DOES_SSR_CSS` to `"mutates-themes"`. This
will still give you the benefits of reduced bundle size, but avoids removing the
entirety of the theme generation JS so it can mutate themes at runtime.

Most bundlers will then be able to shake out all the theme-related CSS
generation code from `@tamagui/core`, saving ~2kb of minified JS. If you set
`outputCSS` option with Next.js, this will be set automatically.

<Notice>
  Make sure the style tag you insert with the `getCSS` styles is inserted after any `react-native-web` style tags to ensure Tamagui overrides those styles.
</Notice>

## Tokens

Tokens have a structure inspired by but divergent from the
[Theme UI spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/). They are mapped to CSS
variables at build time.

### Font tokens

The font tokens are a bit special and are created with `createFont`:

```tsx
const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
    // ...
  },
  lineHeight: {
    1: 17,
    2: 22,
    3: 25,
    // ...
  },
  weight: {
    4: '300',
    6: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    4: 0,
    8: -1,
  },

  // for native only, alternate family based on weight/style
  face: {
    // pass in weights as keys
    700: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    800: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    900: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  Note, you don't need to use numbered keys, you can use `sm` or `tiny` or whatever you'd like. But you do want keep those keys consistent.
</Notice>

This gives you a lot of power over customizing every aspect of your design based
on each font family. In other styling libraries that follow the Theme UI spec,
you generally don't group your size/lineHeight/weight/etc tokens by the family,
which means you are forced to choose a single vertical rhythm no matter the
font.

Things to note:

- The keys of `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight`, and `letterSpacing` are meant to
  match.
- Define the full set of keys on `size`, the rest can be a subset.
- Missing keys from partially defined objects will be filled in.
  - In the example above, `weight` is only defined at `4` and `6`.
  - At creation Tamagui fills in the missing keys with previous value, or the
    next one if no previous exists. So weight `1` === `300`, weight `5` ===
    `300`, and weight `7` === `600`.

### Troubleshooting

Custom fonts not appearing in Tamagui components? Note the `family` definition, on Native it requires a single font name, whereas on web it can include a comma-separated list of fallbacks.

You can use the `isWeb` boolean to do this conditionally on `createFont`:

```tsx
createFont({
  family: isWeb ? 'Custom-Font, Arial, Helvetica, ...' : 'Custom-Font',
  ...rest
})
```

#### Custom Font Family on Native

You need to load your fonts for React Native to recognize them. Typically this
looks something like if using Expo, (or you can
[follow a React Native guide here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35255645/how-to-set-default-font-family-in-react-native)):

```tsx fileName="App.tsx"
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font'

function App() {
  const [loaded] = useFonts({
    Inter: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Medium.otf"),
    InterBold: require("@tamagui/font-inter/otf/Inter-Bold.otf"),
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (loaded) {
      // can hide splash screen here
    }
  }, [loaded])

  if (!loaded) {
    return null;
  }

  return <MyApp />
}
```

---

### Non-font tokens

The rest of the tokens categories besides font are flatter. The `space` and
`size` generally share keys, and that space can generally use negative keys as
well.

```tsx
// passed into createTamagui
const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})
```

You access tokens then by using `$` prefixes in your values. Tamagui knows which
tokens to use based on the style property you use.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <Text fontSize="$lg" lineHeight="$lg" fontFamily="$mono" color="$white">
    Hello world
  </Text>
)
```

One final note: using tokens with themes. Tokens are considered a "fallback" to
themes, so any values you define in your theme will override the token. The next
section will explain this further.

### Configuring tokens

There are a few settings that control how strict your style values are allowed
to be, which are handled by the `settings` option of `createTamagui`. See the
[type strictness settings](#settings) below.

### Themes

Themes live one level below tokens. Tokens are your variables, where themes use
those tokens to create consistent, generic properties that you then typically
use in shareable components. Themes should generally only deal with colors.

Tamagui components in general expect a set of theme keys to be defined like the
following, but you can deviate if you create your own design system.

```tsx
const light = {
  background: '#fff',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray2,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray4,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray5,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray4,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray6,
  borderColorPress: tokens.color.gray12,
  borderColorFocus: tokens.color.gray11,
  color: tokens.color.gray10,
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray9,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray8,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray8,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA4,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA6,
  shadowColorPress: tokens.color.grayA8,
  shadowColorFocus: tokens.color.grayA8,
  ...lightColors,
}
```

You don't have to use tokens as your theme values, but if you do they avoid some
overhead. With Tamagui, the idea is that `bg`, `color`, and `borderColor`
represent the "primary" and clearest colors, and `bg2`, `color2` etc get more
subtle.

To see how it works, here's a snippet from `InteractiveFrame` which is the frame
component that's used in `Button`:

```tsx
export const InteractiveFrame = styled(XStack, {
  borderRadius: '$1',
  paddingVertical: '$2',
  paddingHorizontal: '$3',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  cursor: 'pointer',
  flexWrap: 'nowrap',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  flexShrink: 1,

  hoverStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover',
  },

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundPress',
  },

  // ...
})
```

### Media

For more full docs on media queries, see the
[useMedia docs page](/docs/core/use-media).

### Animations

Choose one of `@tamagui/animations-css` for CSS transition based animations,
`@tamagui/animations-react-native` for React Native Animated based animations,
or `@tamagui/animations-moti` for [Moti](https://moti.fyi) animations. You can
swap them out per-platform as well, so long as you match the keys of the
animations you pass in for each driver.

Add `animations` to `createTamagui`:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'

// pass this exported `animations` to your `createTamagui` call:
export const animations = createAnimations({
    bouncy: {
      damping: 9,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 150,
    },
    lazy: {
      damping: 18,
      stiffness: 50,
    },
  }),
})
```

### Shorthands

Shorthands are defined on `createTamagui`. Here's an example of a partial
shorthands configuration:

```tsx
// the as const ensures types work with the optional `onlyAllowShorthands` option
const shorthands = {
  ac: 'alignContent',
  ai: 'alignItems',
  als: 'alignSelf',
  bblr: 'borderBottomLeftRadius',
  bbrr: 'borderBottomRightRadius',
  bg: 'backgroundColor',
  br: 'borderRadius',
  btlr: 'borderTopLeftRadius',
  btrr: 'borderTopRightRadius',
  f: 'flex',
  // ...
} as const

export default createTamagui({
  shorthands,
})
```

Which will enable usage like:

```tsx
<View br="$myToken" />
```

where `br` expands into `borderRadius`.

#### Type strictness

#### `allowedStyleValues`

- `false (default)`: allows any string (or number for styles that accept numbers)
- `strict`: only allows tokens for any token-enabled properties
- `strict-web`: same as strict but allows for web-specific tokens like
  auto/inherit
- `somewhat-strict`: allow tokens or:
  - for `space/size`: string% or numbers
  - for `radius`: number
  - for `zIndex`: number
  - for `color`: named colors or rgba/hsla strings
- `somewhat-strict-web`: same as somewhat-strict but allows for web-specific
  tokens

```tsx
type AllowedValueSetting =
  | boolean
  | 'strict'
  | 'somewhat-strict'
  | 'strict-web'
  | 'somewhat-strict-web'

type AllowedStyleValuesSetting =
  | AllowedValueSetting
  | {
      space?: AllowedValueSetting
      size?: AllowedValueSetting
      radius?: AllowedValueSetting
      zIndex?: AllowedValueSetting
      color?: AllowedValueSetting
    }
```

#### `autocompleteSpecificTokens`

The VSCode autocomplete puts specific tokens above the regular ones, which leads
to worse DX. If true this setting removes the specific token from types for the
defined categories.

If set to `except-special`, specific tokens will autocomplete only if they don't
normally use one of the special token groups: space, size, radius, zIndex,
color.
