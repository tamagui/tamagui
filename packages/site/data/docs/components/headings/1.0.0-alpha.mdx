# Headings

<Description>Heading components that mimic HTML equivalents.</Description>

The headings all extend from the base Title component:

<HeroContainer>
  <HeadingsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Headings

```

---

Headings all build off the base title component:

```jsx
export const Title = styled(Paragraph, {
  fontFamily: '$title',
  fontWeight: '700',
  size: '$8',
})
```

They expect for your tokens.fontSize to have values for 4-10. The headings work with your font tokens automatically. Note the `size` prop goes to Paragraph, which extends [SizableText](/docs/components/text#sizabletext). This means all the relevant attributes from `letterSpacing` to `weight` get applied.
