<Description>Text, Sized Text and Paragraph show one way to build a design system.</Description>

<HeroContainer demoMultiple>
  <TextDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Text

```

<Highlights
  features={[
    'Supports all react-native-web props and Tamagui styling props.',
    'Media query styles, hoverStyle, pressStyle, focusStyle.',
    'Paragraph uses themes and spread variants for a nicer default.',
  ]}
/>

## Usage

Text in Tamagui matches to Text in react-native-web, just with the added [Tamagui Props](/docs/intro/props).

It explicitly doesn't inherit your theme color or other font properties, as it's meant to be plain and used for extension. Below, we'll show `SizableText` which extends Text, and `Paragraph` which extends SizableText. Generally, Paragraph is the useful view as it will use theme values, while you can extend Text if you'd like to derive your own design system.

```jsx
import { YStack, XStack, Text } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <>
    <Text
      // can add theme values
      color="$white"
      fontFamily="$body"
      // or just use direct values
      fontSize={20}
      hoverStyle={{
        color: '$color2',
      }}
    >
      Lorem ipsum
    </Text>
  </>
)
```

## SizableText

[Seeing how SizableText is defined](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/tamagui/src/views/SizableText.tsx) is helpful for understanding Tamagui. They serve as a good example of how you can extend and compose components.

SizableText simply adds a single `size` property to maniplulate all of:

- fontSize
- lineHeight
- fontWeight
- letterSpacing

Based on the values set in your tokens. It uses [spread variants](/docs/core/styled#spread-variants) feature. Then Paragraph extends that and ensures it defaults to values from your theme - fontSize, lineHeight, color and fontFamily.

## Paragraph

Finally Paragraph extends `SizableText` and simply sets some default values from your theme:

```jsx
export const Paragraph = styled(SizableText, {
  fontFamily: '$body',
  color: '$color',
  size: '$4',
})
```
