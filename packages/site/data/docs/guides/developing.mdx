## Helpful exports

Some useful hooks and constants exist in `@tamagui/core`.

### Constants

For adapting things specifically to web, native, or platform:

- `isWeb` - true if rendering on web SSR or client side, false if native
- `isSSR` - true if web + SSR
- `isClient` - true if web + not SSR
- `isChrome` - true if client + Chrome
- `isWebTouchable` - true if web + touch device
- `isTouchable` - true if isWebTouchable or native
- `isWebIOS` - true if web + iOS

### Helpers

- `isTamaguiElement(child: any; name?: string) => boolean` - match Tamagui React elements.
- `extractable<A extends TamaguiComponent>(): A` - [hints for compiler to extract a HoC component](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/296a71b74d3020a28e3bafd1abb748a67d535be4/packages/tamagui/src/views/Anchor.tsx#L22).
- `getExpandedShorthands(props: Object): Object` - Returns a new object with all shorthand props expanded.

## Importing from React Native

In general either your Webpack configuration or using `@tamagui/next-plugin`, you will be aliasing `react-native` to `react-native-web`. This means you should import anything you need from `react-native` directly and never import for `react-native-web`. Your bundler will handle automatically changing it.

Tamagui (at this time) doesn't have a variety of views like ScrollView or FlatList. If you need them, just import them directly from `react-native`.

## Classes generated

Tamagui generates a few helpful classes. For components created with `styled()` where a `name` is set like this:

```tsx
const MyButton = styled(YStack, {
  name: 'MyButton',
  backgroundColor: 'red',
})
```

Tamagui adds the classname `is_MyButton`. This is a useful escape hatch for attaching CSS to any extra component. All the default Tamagui components have their name set.

For component that extends a Text-based component, a further classname is set of the format `font_[fontFamily]`. So if you do:

```tsx
<Paragraph fontFamily="$body" />
```

The classnames `is_Paragraph` and `font_body` will be output to DOM.

## Debugging

Tamagui has two three of giving you a lot more insight into what's happening at compile-time.

### Debug pragma

To see what's being extracted, why, and every step along the optimization pipeline, add `// debug` to the top of any file. Adding `// debug-verbose` will show even more information, including more granular timings.

If you're developing in your design system package that is built with @tamagui/build, esbuild will strip this banner. You can try using `//! debug` (esbuild only preserves comments at the top that start with `//!`), but still occasionally esbuild will insert a helpers above the comment, breaking it, so be sure to check the built file in `dist/jsx`.

### Debug prop

Adding `debug` to any Tamagui component will output a lot of information on what's going on at runtime. Use it like so:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default () => <Button debug>Hello world</Button>
```

And you'll see props, styles, and a variety of variables relevant to processing them.

You can do `<Button debug="break" />` to have it break at the beginning of rendering, or `<Button debug="verbose" />` to have it output more detailed debug information.

### DEBUG env

If you set `DEBUG=tamagui` before your build command, you will get the full debug output of every file built. This is useful for seeing everything that's happening across every file, and especially helpful for diagnosing production issues.

## Runtime introspection

In development mode, Tamagui sets the variable `Tamagui` onto `globalThis` with a lot of helpful internals, including your entire parsed config from `tamagui.config.ts`.

Beyond your config, you have:

- **allSelectors**: All the selectors inserted by Tamagui (before runtime).

### Inspecting Components

Any `styled()` component will have a `staticConfig` property attached to it:

```tsx
const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 1000,
})

console.log(Circle.staticConfig) // lots of helpful information
```

- `componentName` is taken from the `name` key
- `variants` contains the merged variants including parents.
- `defaultProps` is the extracted props left to use as defaults on the component.
