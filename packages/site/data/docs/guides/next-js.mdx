<Notice>We're putting together a better guide soon!</Notice>

If you'd like to get a good idea of a set up with Next.js, this site itself it built with it. It supports full SSR with all the features.

Check out the [source for this site](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/site) to see a good example, especially the `next.config.js`, `tamagui.config.ts`, and the `themes.ts` and `colors.ts`.
