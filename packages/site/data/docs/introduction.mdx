Stitches is a lightweight, performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

## Performance

### Near-Zero Runtime

At Modulz, performance is paramount. So when designing Stitches, performance was a top priority.

Stitches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it significantly more performant than other styling libraries.

Both `@stitches/core` and `@stitches/react` libraries weigh in at ~6kb gzipped.

### Server-Side Rendering

Many UI libraries document that responsive variants don't work with server-side rendering. Since popular frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) have begun prioritising SSR, we wanted a solution that works well.

Stitches supports cross-browser [server-side rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering), even for responsive styles and variants.

## Key Features

### Variants

Stitches introduces [variants](/docs/variants) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs.

You can define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [compound variants](/docs/variants#compound-variants) which allow you to define styles based on a combination of variants.

Variants can be applied conditionally or responsively.

### Tokens

One of the most exciting features is the ability to define your own [tokens](/docs/tokens) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can even be used in shorthand CSS properties.

### Theming

Stitches provides a simple [theming](/docs/theming) experience out of the box. Create as many themes as you need, and apply them wherever you want. Each theme generates a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

```jsx
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    hiContrast: 'hsl(206,2%,93%)',
    loContrast: 'hsl(206,8%,8%)',

    gray100: 'hsl(206,8%,12%)',
    gray200: 'hsl(206,7%,14%)',
    gray300: 'hsl(206,7%,15%)',
    gray400: 'hsl(206,7%,24%)',
    gray500: 'hsl(206,7%,30%)',
    gray600: 'hsl(206,5%,53%)',
  },
  space: {},
  fonts: {},
});
```

### Utils

[Utils](/docs/utils) allow you to create your own custom CSS Properties, with your own API.

Use utils to create powerful combinations of properties, property aliases and to introduce restrictions when needed.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  utils: {
    marginX: (value) => ({
      marginLeft: value,
      marginRight: value,
    }),
    marginY: (value) => ({
      marginTop: value,
      marginBottom: value,
    }),
  },
});
```

### Responsive Variants

Stitches lets you configure [breakpoints](/docs/responsive-styles) and apply variants responsively using the `css` prop. CSS at-rules can also be used inline if needed.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  media: {
    bp1: '(min-width: 640px)',
    bp2: '(min-width: 768px)',
    bp3: '(min-width: 1024px)',
    bp4: '(min-width: 1280px)',
  },
});
```

### Overrides

Stitches provides a `css` prop for overriding styles on any Stitches component. You can use this prop to define layout concerns and/or [overrides](/docs/overriding-styles). Tokens and breakpoints also work in the `css` prop.

```jsx
<Button css={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>Button</Button>
```

Stitches also provides a polymorphic `as` prop for defining which tag a component renders.

```jsx
<Text as="h1">Heading</Text>
<Text as="p">Paragraph</Text>
```

### Developer Experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Stitches provides a fully-typed API, so when using TypeScript, CSS properties, values, and breakpoints will be auto-completed for you.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions will update.
