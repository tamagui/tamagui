description: How to create and use themes in Tamagui.

Themes in Tamagui are very powerful:

- You can nest themes as much as you want. So `dark` can have `dark_green` and `dark_red`.
- A theme that ends in a capitalized segment will match to a styled component:
  - So `styled(Stack, { name: 'MyComponent' })` will always look for a theme named like:
    - `dark_MyComponent` if the current theme is `dark`
    - `dark_green_MyComponent` if the current theme is `dark_green`
- If you have `dark`, `light` and `dark_green` and `light_green`, you can do partial name matches:

```tsx
export default () => (
  <Theme name="dark">
    <Theme name="green">
      {/* dark_green is set */}
    </Theme>
    <Theme name="light_green">
      {/* light_green is set */}
    </Theme>
    <Theme name="light">
      <Theme name="green">
        {/* light_green is set */}

        <Theme name="dark">
          {/* no theme named light_green_dark, so dark is set */}
        </Theme>
      </Theme>
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
)
```

- In each theme, you can set any key to any value you like, but:
  - Your top level themes should always be super-sets of children, because:
    - Children themes re-use CSS variables from parents
    - Children themes fall back to parents' value when theirs are not set.
- We recommend manually typing your final theme object to be like so, to keep your TypeScript typings stable and accurate:
  - `Record<keyof themes, typeof light>`

In `tamagui`, we've standardized on certain theme keys in order to have every component be able to be themed:

- These color keys: `background`, `color`, `borderColor`, `shadowColor`
  - Plus pseudo variants for each, eg `backgroundHover`, `backgroundPress`, `backgroundFocus`

Themes make assumptions about `light` and `dark`, if you define these two base themes, you'll avoid full-tree re-renders when they're changed on web.

### Quick start with @tamagui/theme-base

To get started quickly, you can use the themes we've developed alongside this site and with other apps, `@tamagui/theme-base`. It's even easier to see how it all comes together by using [create-tamagui-app to bootstrap](/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app).

To install, just add import it and add it to your `tamagui.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { createInterFont } from '@tamagui/font-inter'
import { color, radius, size, space, themes, zIndex } from '@tamagui/theme-base'
import { createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui'

const inter = createInterFont()

const tokens = createTokens({
  font: {
    heading: inter,
    body: inter,
  },
  size,
  space,
  zIndex,
  color,
  radius,
})

const config = createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
})

export type Conf = typeof config

declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default config
```

### Example

Let's start with an example of inline styling with a subset of the configuration:

```jsx
import { createTokens, createTamagui, YStack, Theme } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    darkRed: '#550000'
    lightRed: '#ff0000'
  }
})

const { Provider } = createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      red: tokens.color.darkRed,
    },
    light: {
      red: tokens.color.lightRed,
    }
  }
})

export const App = () => (
  <Provider defaultTheme="light">
    <YStack backgroundColor="$red" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <YStack backgroundColor="$red" />
    </Theme>
  </Provider>
)
```

In this example we've set up darkRed and lightRed variables and a a dark and light theme that use those variables. Tamagui will handle defining:

```css
:root {
  --colors-dark-red: #550000;
  --colors-light-red: #ff0000;
}

.tui_dark {
  --red: var(--colors-dark-red);
}

.tui_light {
  --red: var(--colors-light-red);
}
```

Which will automatically apply at runtime, or can be gathered for use in SSR using `Tamagui.getCSS()`.

Finally, the compiler on web will extract your views roughly as so:

```jsx
export const App = () => (
  <Provider defaultTheme="light">
    <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    </Theme>
  </Provider>
)

// CSS output:
//  .color-2nesi3 { background-color: var(--red); }
```

### Ensuring valid types

Here's what we've landed on which helps ensure everything is typed properly. Use `createTheme`, which is a simple helper for creating a theme and having all the values turned into variables. Keep themes in a separate `themes.ts` file, and structure it like this:

```jsx
import { createTheme } from 'tamagui'
import { tokens } from './tokens'

const lightTheme = createTheme({
  background: '#fff',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray3,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray4,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray5,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray4,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray6,
  color: tokens.color.gray12,
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray11,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray10,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray6,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA5,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA6,
})

// note: we set up a consistent theme type to validate the rest:
type BaseTheme = typeof lightTheme

// the rest of the themes use BaseTheme
const dark: BaseTheme = {
  background: '#000',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray2Dark,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray3Dark,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray4Dark,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray3Dark,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray4Dark,
  color: '#ddd',
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray11Dark,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray10Dark,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray6Dark,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA6,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA7,
}

// if you need to add non-token values, use createTheme
const darkTranslucent: BaseTheme = createTheme({
  ...dark,
  background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.7)',
  backgroundHover: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
  backgroundPress: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.25)',
  backgroundFocus: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.1)',
})

const lightTranslucent: BaseTheme = createTheme({
  ...light,
  background: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.85)',
  backgroundHover: 'rgba(250,250,250,0.85)',
  backgroundPress: 'rgba(240,240,240,0.85)',
  backgroundFocus: 'rgba(240,240,240,0.7)',
})

// use `as const` at the end here to be sure its strictly typed
export const themes = {
  dark,
  light,
  'translucent-dark': darkTranslucent,
  'translucent-light': lightTranslucent,
  ...colorThemes,
} as const
```

### Subset themes

One of the real powers of Tamagui is theme nesting, which we'll explain below, but which is important to understand. If you define a theme with the name in the form `[parentName]_[subName]`, Tamagui then accepts `<Theme name="[subName]" />` as though it's valid.

You can do this as many times as you'd like. For example you can have the following themes:

- `dark_green_subtle`
- `light_green_subtle`

And you're able to then access them (fully typed):

```tsx
<Theme name="dark">
  <Theme name="green">
    <Button theme="subtle">Hello world</Button>
  </Theme>
</Theme>
```

You can also do:

```tsx
<Theme name="dark_green">
  <Button theme="subtle">Hello world</Button>
</Theme>
```

#### Component subset themes

Finally, each component in Tamagui can be set up to accept a component specific theme by passing the `name` property to the second argument of `styled()`. For example, for the Button component, we define the frame of it like so:

```tsx
const ButtonFrame = styled(SizableFrame, {
  name: 'Button',
  tag: 'button',
})
```

<Notice>
  We've decided to enforce the first letter being capitalized. This makes it easier to users to
  distinguish component themes, and allows Tamagui internally to avoid extra work and nesting.
</Notice>

The `name` attribute will be removed from the defaultProps and used internally by Tamagui to check for the sub-theme that matches. This means any theme named with an ending of `_Button` will apply. So you can add the following themes to customize buttons at any level:

- `dark_Button`
- `dark_green_Button`
- `dark_green_subtle_Button`
