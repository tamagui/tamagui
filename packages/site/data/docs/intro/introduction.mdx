description: The how and why of Tamagui
---

**Tamagui lets you share more code between web and native apps without sacrificing DX, performance, and accessibility**. It turns natural syntax for **responsive styles**, **themes**, and **inline styles** into, on the web: atomic classes, media queries, and CSS variables, and on native to an optimized StyleSheet.create.

The compiler paritally evaluates many common logical operations, spreads and more, and flattens any fully analyzable views into a simple HTML tags on web or View/Text on native.

### React Native ❤️

Work with your favorite libraries: `react-native` and `react-native-web`. Tamagui improves typical performance with an optimizing compiler - especially with media queries, themes, and dynamic styles.

### Themed, Responsive

Hooks `useTheme` and `useMedia` and inline theme and media styling work just how you'd expect them to. But they compile to clean CSS media queries and CSS variables.

### Faster Runtime

Not just 0 prop interpolation, but 0 prop interpolation on inline styles and dynamic styles. Even with complex logical styling you get less runtime, light CSS output, and flatter component trees. Plus CSS media queries and CSS variables run much faster than JS ones.

### Less Runtime

Less JS to parse, especially when doing logic in your render function. Ternaries, object spreads, and more get extracted. Strictly style components (with no un-parseable props) are flattened to `div` or `span`, saving tree depth and hook calls.

### Server-Side Rendering

Tamagui supports cross-browser server-side rendering ([see how we do it with Next.js](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/site)), even for responsive styles and variants.

## Key Features

### Variants

[Variants](/docs/core/styled) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs. Define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [Spread Variants](/docs/core/styled#spread-variants) which allow you to return dynamic styles, even at compile-time.

### Tokens

Define your own [tokens](/docs/intro/configuration) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can even be used in shorthand CSS properties.

### Themes

Tamagui provides a simple [theming](/docs/intro/themes) experience out of the box. Create as many themes as you need, and apply them wherever you want. Each theme generates a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

### Shorthands

[Shorthands](/docs/intro/configuration#shorthands) allow you to map shorthand properties to their longer cousins. This lets you create Tailwinds-like quick properties to style. These work with TypeScript as well, and are designed so you can bring them with you across different tamagui component kits.

### Responsive

Tamagui lets you configure [media queries](/docs/core/use-media) and apply variants responsively using `$` props.

### Developer Experience

Tamagui provides a fully-typed API so all your TypeScript style properties, values, media queries and shorthands will be auto-completed for you. It provides a `// debug` pragma and `debug` prop that both allow easy introspection into whats happening at compile and runtime. In dev mode it puts a `data-` attribute that links every DOM node back to your original source.

### Why inline style props?

#### 🏎 Faster to write

Inline styles have a few developer-speed benefits over `StyleSheet.create`: they require fewer imports and fewer lines of code, and they save you from jumping between the top and bottom of your file whenever you want to change a style so you can see exactly whats happening where it's happening.

#### 💀 Easier to maintain, no dead code

`StyleSheet.create` forces you to manually link together the style with the node that's using the style. When you delete the style, you must delete the node, and when you delete a node, you have to manually check to be see if any other node is using that style before removing it.

#### 📚 Less reading/writing

Fast inline styles and common tokens mean less having to name things. Shorthand style props that are flat often make the difference between one line and multiple.

#### 🤨 Less forced naming

With StyleSheets you must name every style group, and even every ternary conditional style or else you lose performance. With inline styles you avoid both problems, leading to more creative experimentation and less friction.

#### 💃 Encourages dynamic styles

Changing between a style that's determined by a ternary or conditional and one that's static shouldn't be a hard choice. With StyleSheet there's some friction as you have to either inline it and save time and readability or extract it to the bottom and gain performance. With inline styles (and the compiler) you no longer have that friction: convert any prop to have a ternary and it works the same, and runs fast.
