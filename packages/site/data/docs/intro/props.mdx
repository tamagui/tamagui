title: Tamagui Props
description: All the properties supported on base Tamagui components.
---

Tamagui uses a superset of the style properties that are supported in React Native and React Native Web, and flattens them onto the direct properties of Stack and Text ([see why below](#why-inline-style-props)).

For the full list of style and non-style props, see:

- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), or
- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props)

You may also want to reference the [react-native-web docs](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/) for more on props related to:

- [Accessibility](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/accessibility/)
- [Interactions](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/interactions/)
- [Localization](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/localization/)

Tamagui adds a few extra props, [read those below](#tamagui-props).

### Style prop ordering

Tamagui props are sensitive to their order. This is actually a huge feature, that without would leave you with impossible styling challenges. Let's first explain how it works, and then why it's necessary.

#### How it works

You define a new styled component:

```tsx
const CalHeader = styled(Text, {
  variants: {
    isHero: {
      fontSize: 36,
      backgroundColor: 'blue',
      color: 'white',
    }
  }
})
```

And then use it in a view you're building:

```tsx
export const MyCalendar = (props: { isHero?: boolean; headerFontSize?: number }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {/* ... some other components... */}
      <CalHeader isHero={props.isHero} fontSize={props.headerFontSize}>
        {monthName}
      </CalHeader>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Why it's important

Notice two things: `isHero` sets a variety of properties, but you want to allow overriding one of those properties, `fontSize`.

If Tamagui didn't respect the order of the props on the JSX element of `CalHeader`, you wouldn't know if the `isHero` font size wins, or if the `headerFontSize` wins.

CSS does a "last defined style wins", which is a huge pain because it means you have to carefully manage the order your CSS is actually loaded into the document. Tamagui could do something similar, with a "inline props always win, defined props go in order of definition", but this would be dramatically less flexible.

Especially when it comes to spreading props downwards. Because Tamagui supports prop order, you have complete control over which styles you want to always win, vs which can be overriden by a user:

```tsx
export const MyCalendarHeader = (props: CalHeaderProps) => {
  return (
    <CalHeader isHero {...props} fontSize={36}>
      {monthName}
    </CalHeader>
  )
}
```

This component defaults to `isHero` styles, but if a user passes in `isHero` as `false`, it will disable all those styles. But because `fontSize` is **always** after the spread, it will always be set to 36.

### Tamagui props

Outside of flat style properties, Tamagui adds the following props:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'theme',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          Apply a [theme or sub-theme](/docs/intro/themes) to this component and the components
          below it.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'className',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Only affects web apps, giving an escape hatch to set the
          className directly. This works fully with the compiler, which will concat your defined
          className with its generated class names.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'tag',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Renders the final DOM property using the given tag.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    
    {
      name: 'space',
      required: false,
      type: "boolean | string | TamaguiConfig['space']",
      description: (
        <span>
          Spacing is built into Tamagui and can accept a number or token.space value. This will
          filter out any nullish child elements and insert a spacer component between the remaining
          elements.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'spaceDirection',
      required: false,
      default: 'both',
      type: `'row' | 'column' | 'both'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          By default the space inserted is a square, but if you set it to row it will be 0px tall,
          column will be 0px wide.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'separator',
      required: false,
      type: "React.ReactNode",
      description: (
        <span>
          Insert a separator between every child. If space is provided, the separator will appear with a space on either side.
        </span>
      ),
    },

    {
      name: 'fullscreen',
      required: false,
      type: `boolean`,
      description: <span>Sets position absolute, and top, left, right, and bottom all to 0.</span>,
    },
    {
      name: 'debug',
      required: false,
      type: `boolean | 'verbose' | 'break'`,
      description: (
        <span>
          When set Tamagui will output a variety of helpful information on how it parsed and
          applied styling. Verbose will output more information, and break will hit a debugger at
          the start of render in development mode.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'asChild',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          When true, Tamagui expects a single child element to which it will pass all to, merging together any event handling props.
        </span>
      ),
    },

]}
/>

### Text props

For Text and all parents of Text components, you add the following props (beyond react-native-web):

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'selectable',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: <span>Sets cursor to text, and userSelect to text.</span>,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Flat transform properties

For styling, Tamagui adds flattened transform properties, pseudo states and media queries:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'x',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'y',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scale',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scale }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'perspective',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ perspective }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'matrix',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ matrix }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotate',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotate }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateZ',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateZ }]',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Pseudo style props

Support for `hoverStyle`, `pressStyle`, and `focusStyle` is helpful as it turns what typically is complex stateful code into pure CSS on web, and a more performant StyleSheet.create (compared to inline styles) for native. They can be used with media queries as well.

```tsx
<Text color="red" hoverStyle={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'hoverStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Web only: Applies the given style on hover',
    },
    {
      name: 'pressStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Applies the given style on press',
    },
    {
      name: 'focusStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
      description: 'Applies the given style on focus',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Media query style props

Based on whatever media queries you define in `createTamagui`, you can now use any of them to apply styling on native and web using the `$` prefix.

If you defined your media query like:

```tsx
createTamagui({
  media: {
    sm: { maxWidth: 800 },
  },
})
```

Then you can use it like:

```tsx
<Text color="red" $sm={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

### Hover Events

Tamagui adds events above the typical react-native/react-native-web View/Text props. These are:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'onHoverIn',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: HoverEvent) => void',
      description: 'Web only: maps to onMouseEnter',
    },
    {
      name: 'onHoverOut',
      required: false,
      type: '(e: HoverEvent) => void',
      description: 'Web only: maps to onMouseLeave',
    },

]}
/>
