Tamagui enters beta!

Six months, hundreds of bugs, 3 demo apps, 1 benchmark suite, 2 big new features, and a refrshed site. We're finally releasing Tamagui into beta.

Here's what's new:

### Start faster

With **create-tamagui-app**, get started fast with Expo, Next.js, and Tamagui:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest my-app
```

### Themes v2

Themes has been redone to add a ton of flexiblity and power. Tamagui now supports unlimited sub-themes, and per-component theming. Further, we've standardized the names of theme props, giving full control to customize any aspect of every component.

<ScrollView horizontal showsHorizontalScrollbars={false}>
  <XStack py="$4">
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</ScrollView>

We've also fixed and improved a lot of how the `@tamagui/feather-icons`, the `Button` component, and the theme engine all work together to automatically handle passing values between each other.

[Read the docs for more on how](/docs/intro/themes).

### Animations

Animations are making their way, experimentally, into `@tamagui/core`. They are unstable, but we want to get feedback and use them more in practice.

They're implemented as pluggable drivers, starting with two:

- [CSS](/docs/core/animations#css)
- [Reanimated](/docs/core/animations#css)

Which means you can swap entire animation drivers depending on your platform. Want lighter bundles on web, but spring animations on native? Use both packages, and swap them out based on your environment.

### New Components

Over the last few months we've added:

- [Inputs](/docs/components/forms)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Separator](/docs/components/separator)
- [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse) and [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset)
- [Popover](/docs/components/popover) and [HoverablePopover](/docs/components/hoverable-popover)
- [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip)
- [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer)
- [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes)
- [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements)

These are big, helpful components and we've made sure each works fully with the optimizing compiler and full suite of react-native and Tamagui properties.

But this is also just the start. There's tons of room to grow and improve. We're looking at using [Floating UI]() to improve the various floating panels. We'll continue to add form components that can share fully consistent styles. And much more.

### Focus styling

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`.

### ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to have your theme reset to the one above it. ThemeReset does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you're doing automatic light/dark themes - it will still work, but there may be a flash on first load. There's a fix for this that is a bit involved,so we think it's still useful to release as experimental until we land that.

### Renaming space to gap

As we're moving from alpha to beta, we're going to take this chance to make breaking changes. To better align with the flexbox spec, `space` has been renamed to `gap`.

### And much more...

- Hundreds of bug-fixes.
- Six new pages added to docs, and every docs page has been improved.
- Smarter styled() function - now automatically detects Text/View components and properly handles their styling/types. It also detects Inputs and a wider range of react-native components for automatic styling.

### Acknowledgements

This release once again is inspired by or forks code from a variety of other libraries and developers.

I'd like to thank:

- Fenando Rojo and [Moti]() for the elegant reanimated animation driver that served as the starting point of `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`.
- \_ and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion) for the base of AnimatePresence in `@tamagui/animate-presence`.
- Tailwind for the inspiration of using a nice resizable browser to demo responsive design.
