<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a universal UI kit for React Native and Web, making it much easier to ship performant,
  beautiful apps across all platforms using the same code. It makes hard things easy - like themes,
  responsive styling, and animation.
</IntroParagraph>

**At its core are three libraries**:

<IntroParagraph>
  <UL>
    <LI>A style library (`@tamagui/core`) for creating React Native + Web components.</LI>
    <LI>An optimizing compiler (`@tamagui/static`) for incredible performance.</LI>
    <LI>A component kit (`tamagui`) built using both of the above.</LI>
  </UL>
</IntroParagraph>

It's been six months since the first alpha, [several hundreds of bugfixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0), [three demo apps](https://github.com/tamagui), ten new components, and now a few big new core features. Plus, a [refreshed site](/), a [benchmark suite](/docs/intro/benchmarks), a host of type improvements, and compatibility with more versions of Next.js, Webpack, and React Native.

What's new?

### Get started faster 🚀

Introducing [**create-tamagui-app**](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/create-tamagui-app), to get started much faster with a bootstrapped monorepo that uses Expo, Next.js, Solito and Tamagui:

```bash
npx create-tamagui-app@latest
```

You can even clone + deploy it instantly with Vercel and Github:

<XStack my="$4" jc="center">
  <DeployToVercel />
</XStack>

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo.

### Themes 2.0 🎨

Theme internally have been completely redone, and they're really fun. They work better, nest better, and come with a generator out of the box in `@tamagui/theme-base`.

They now default to names that map to standard style names with optional pseudo postfixes, so for `color`, the alternates `colorHover`, `colorFocus`, and `colorPress` are definable.

Building off that, themes can nest unlimited times - `dark` and `light` can have `dark_blue` and `light_blue`, and then different tints below that, like `dark_blue_alt1`.

<HeroContainer>
  <XStack miw={500} py="$4" ai="center">
    <YStack mx={-16} scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="pink" />
    </YStack>
    <YStack mx={-16} scale={0.8}>
      <MediaPlayerDemo theme="blue_alt3" />
    </YStack>
  </XStack>
</HeroContainer>

The `theme` prop is now also available on every component, including ones you create using the `styled` factory function.

Component now apply any sub-theme that matches their name - so `Button`, will look for `dark_blue_Button` if it exists, giving complete control the UI at the theme level, across every component. PLus, icons, buttons and more components have been upgraded to better handle passing themes down automatically.

**I'm really happy with how this landed**. This release could have focused more on new components, but it became obvious while working on [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip) / [Popover](/docs/components/popover) / [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer) that _getting animations and themes right needed to happen first_ to avoid future pain.

We now have a very solid foundation.

[Read the docs for much more on themes](/docs/intro/themes).

### Animations

Animations are making their way, experimentally, into `@tamagui/core`. They are unstable, but we want to get feedback and use them more in practice.

<OffsetBox my="$4">
  <XStack py="$4">
    <ExampleAnimations />
  </XStack>
</OffsetBox>

They're implemented as pluggable drivers, starting with two:

- [CSS](/docs/core/animations#css)
- [Reanimated](/docs/core/animations#css)

Which means you can swap entire animation drivers depending on your platform. Want lighter bundles on web, but spring animations on native? Install both packages and swap them out based on your environment.

We've also added a new pseudo `enterStyle` that works if you have an `animation` prop set, giving you easy styling on mount (and see the next section for `exitStyle`).

[Read the docs on animations](/docs/core/animations) to get started.

#### AnimatePresence

In early form, we've added [AnimatePresence](/docs/core/animations#animate-presence), which is directly forked off Framer Motion. It works with `exitStyle` and variants to make once-complex animations quite easy.

<HeroContainer noPad>
  <AnimationsPresenceDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=AnimationsPresence

```

---

### New Components

We've added quite a few new components, and a good portion more are nearing release. Since the alpha we've introduced: [Inputs](/docs/components/inputs), [Label](/docs/components/label), [Switch](/docs/components/switch), [Image](/docs/components/image), [Separator](/docs/components/separator), [ThemeInverse](/docs/core/theme#theme-inverse), [Popover](/docs/components/popover), [Tooltip](/docs/components/tooltip), [Drawer](/docs/components/drawer), [Square and Circle](/docs/components/shapes), [HTML Elements](/docs/components/html-elements).

Here's the new Switch component working with spring animations:

<HeroContainer>
  <SwitchDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Switch

```

### Styled Factory Upgrades

The `styled()` factory function as well gets many upgrades, it accepts React Native components directly and automatically interprets their props, as well as many fixes - full media query support, _much_ faster/accurate types, and better compilation.

---

### Popover

Popover was introduced in alpha, but we've redone it for the beta. It's still early stage, but the API is significantly improved. It now gives you much more control over the target, content and trigger. Importantly, it works using Tamagui primitives, and automatically wraps your content in [AnimatePresence](/docs/core/animations#animate-presence) supporting beautiful and simple enter/exit animations.

The core of Popover is now powered by the wonderful [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/), saving us a lot of complexity and giving it more reliable and powerful behaviors.

It's also been split out optionally into it's own package at `@tamagui/popover`.

Show the code below to see the improved component-based API.

<HeroContainer>
  <PopoverDemo />
</HeroContainer>

---

### Tooltip

Tooltip likewise was rebuilt in a similar fashion to Popover - a composable component API, full animation support, and powered by [Floating UI's React DOM Interactions](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-dom-interactions).

<HeroContainer>
  <TooltipDemo />
</HeroContainer>

---

### Other Component Updates

[LinearGradient](/docs/components/linear-gradient), [Image](/docs/components/image), and [Button](/docs/components/button) have received lots of love. LinearGradient now fully supports all theme values and the compiler will help it extract any style properties. Image should still be considered beta, but has gone through many rounds of bugfixes and improvements. And Button now handles passing more text properties down, themes and sizes icons more reliably, and has many fixes for variants like `circular`.

---

### Focus Styles

We landed experimental support for the `focusStyle` prop, which works much like `pressStyle` and `hoverStyle`. You can see it in action on `Input`:

<HeroContainer>
  <FormsDemo />
</HeroContainer>

```jsx hero template=Forms

```

---

### ThemeReset

Sometimes you want to reset the current theme to the grandparent. [ThemeReset](/docs/core/theme#theme-reset) does just this. Note: it's not SSR compatible if you use automatic light/dark themes (it will still work, but it won't fully render until JS runs). There's a fix for this that is a bit involved, but we think it's still useful to release it as experimental.

---

### Theme Generation

Use the themes from the Tamagui site itself without any setup at all, simply install `@tamagui/theme-base` and add `themes` and `tokens` to `createTamagui()` in your `tamagui.config.ts`.

Likewise, we've released `@tamagui/shorthands`, nice default shorthands out of the box.

[See the site tamagui.config.ts for a clear example](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/39079fb064d58dd524194d0175014ae913b0da6e/packages/site/tamagui.config.ts#L5).

---

### Feather Icons

We've released [@tamagui/feather-icons](/docs/components/feather-icons), which have numerous adjustments to work well with themes and sizing.

You can import and use them directly, or pass them to Buttons:

```tsx
import { Play } from '@tamagui/feather-icons'
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

// theme and size are properly passed from Button to icons automatically
export default () => <Button size="$6" icon={Play} />
```

---

### And much more...

- 🐛 [Hundreds of bug-fixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0).
- ✨ Many docs improvements: new pages, more examples, more props documented, and search.
- 🐛 Much improved install experience and many bugs fixed with Next, Webpack, Monorepos.

---

### Breaking changes

- Sub themes now must be named with `_` (underscore) separators.
- In tamagui.config.ts, `tokens.font` => `fonts`.
- Popover and Tooltip are redone in with Radix-style nested components
  - We've exported a small `TooltipSimple` component that mimics the old Tooltip
- HoverablePopover has been removed in favor of just Tooltip or customizing Popover

---

### Going forward

There's a ton of progress here, but likewise a ton more to go. There's many components, docs, and features to be written, and I'd like to get better at community and sharing progress from here on out.

What really excites me is the foundations laid. Tamagui now has such a rich set of primitives - from animations, themes, and sizing, to performance even including things like media queries, to all the helpers and hooks adopted since alpha that make designing Radix-like composable API's a breeze, all the way to adopting Floating UI and all the powerful primitives now available - everything feels like it works together well, and as of late the composability and flexiblity haven't blocked design of even complex use-cases (✊🪵).

Seeing Tooltip come to life somewhat easily in the latest refactor just by importing a few hooks and components and giving it an `animation` prop was really inspiring.

I've always wanted to build beautiful apps, but doing so has always felt like either I needed to limit the ambition, the features, the platforms supported, or the dream altogether - without massive investment.

With the latest Tamagui, the bar feels decisively lowered to where building _an actually beautiful_ app that scales to great ambition is actually within reach.
