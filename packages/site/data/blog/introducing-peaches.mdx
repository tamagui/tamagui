Peaches is a lightweight, performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

In this post I'll provide an overview of our goals and priorities, and highlight some features.

---

### Performance

#### Near-Zero Runtime

At Modulz, performance is paramount. We use WebGL where possible, but in the React layer, we need things as fast as possible too. So when designing Peaches, performance was a top priority.

Peaches avoids unnecessary prop interpolations at runtime, making it significantly more performant than other styling libraries.

Both `@peaches/core` and `@peaches/react` libraries weigh in at ~6.0kb gzipped.

#### Server-Side Rendering

Many UI libraries document that responsive variants don't work with server-side rendering. Since popular frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) have begun prioritising SSR, we wanted a solution that works well.

Peaches supports cross-browser [server-side rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering), even for responsive styles and variants.

### Key Features

#### Variants

Peaches introduces [variants](/docs/variants) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs.

You can define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [compound variants](/docs/variants#compound-variants) which allow you to define styles based on a combination of variants.

Variants can be applied conditionally or responsively.

#### Tokens

One of the most exciting features is the ability to define your own [tokens](/docs/tokens) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can even be used in shorthand CSS properties.

#### Theming

Peaches provides a simple [theming](/docs/theming) experience out of the box. Create as many themes as you need, and apply them wherever you want. Each theme generates a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

```jsx
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    hiContrast: 'hsl(206,2%,93%)',
    loContrast: 'hsl(206,8%,8%)',

    gray100: 'hsl(206,8%,12%)',
    gray200: 'hsl(206,7%,14%)',
    gray300: 'hsl(206,7%,15%)',
    gray400: 'hsl(206,7%,24%)',
    gray500: 'hsl(206,7%,30%)',
    gray600: 'hsl(206,5%,53%)',
  },
  space: {},
  fonts: {},
});
```

#### Utils

[Utils](/docs/utils) allow you to create your own custom CSS Properties, with your own API.

Use utils to create powerful combinations of properties, property aliases and to introduce restrictions when needed.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createPeaches({
  utils: {
    marginX: (value) => ({
      marginLeft: value,
      marginRight: value,
    }),
    marginY: (value) => ({
      marginTop: value,
      marginBottom: value,
    }),
  },
});
```

#### Responsive Variants

Peaches lets you configure [breakpoints](/docs/responsive-styles) and apply variants responsively using the `css` prop. CSS at-rules can also be used inline if needed.

```jsx
export const { styled, css } = createPeaches({
  media: {
    bp1: '(min-width: 640px)',
    bp2: '(min-width: 768px)',
    bp3: '(min-width: 1024px)',
    bp4: '(min-width: 1280px)',
  },
});
```

#### Overrides

Peaches provides a `css` prop for overriding styles on any Peaches component. You can use this prop to define layout concerns and/or [overrides](/docs/overriding-styles). Tokens and breakpoints also work in the `css` prop.

```jsx
<Button css={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>Button</Button>
```

Peaches also provides a polymorphic `as` prop for defining which tag a component renders.

```jsx
<Text as="h1">Heading</Text>
<Text as="p">Paragraph</Text>
```

#### Developer Experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Peaches provides a fully-typed API, so when using TypeScript, CSS properties, values, and breakpoints will be auto-completed for you.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions will update.

### A quick tutorial

#### 1. Install it

```bash
npm install @peaches/react
```

#### 2. Set it up

```jsx
import { createStyled } from '@peaches/react';

export const { styled, css } = createPeaches({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      gray100: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)',
      gray200: 'hsl(206,12%,97%)',
      gray300: 'hsl(206,11%,92%)',
      gray400: 'hsl(206,10%,84%)',
      gray500: 'hsl(206,10%,76%)',
    },
    space: {
      1: '5px',
      2: '10px',
      3: '15px',
    },
    fontSizes: {
      1: '12px',
      2: '13px',
      3: '15px',
    },
  },
});
```

#### 3. Style your first component

```jsx live manual
const Button = styled('button', {
  backgroundColor: '$gray300',
  borderRadius: '9999px',
  fontSize: '$2',
  lineHeight: '1',
  fontWeight: 500,
  padding: '$2 $3',
  border: '0',

  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: '$gray500',
  },
});

render(<Button>Button</Button>);
```

You can learn more about how to use Peaches in our [documentation](/docs).
