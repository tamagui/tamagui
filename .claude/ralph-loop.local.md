id liek to see a full-on native version working, verified and tested, benchamrked against regular rn, regular tamagui and old optimized tamagui, and even unistyles itself, id like to see also that we support the more advanced use cases, and doing it where we wrap all components fully perhaps even just by shimming jsx/createElement such that we can avoid all tearing as well, with a full-on large bench that has a big example of a complex scrreen with a bunchf of list-items with content displayed in a virtualized list such that we can demonstrate scrolling is greatly imrpoved, and we can theme switch not just light dark but also sub-themes with basically no re-rendering, this should take many iteraionts so keep a plan file and review it each iteration, use TDD and ensure test and checks work each iteration as well, and be thoroguh and review your plan and add more steps. you tend to pretend youre further along than you are so in general take things off your 'done' list and verify the tests are thorough not just faked --max-iterations=50
