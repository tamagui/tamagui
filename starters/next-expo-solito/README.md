## 🔦 About

This monorepo is a starter for an Expo + Next.js + Tamagui + Solito app.

Many thanks to  [@FernandoTheRojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for the Solito starter monorepo which this was forked from. Check out his [talk about using expo + next together at Next.js Conf 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lnbdRweJtA).

## 📦 Included packages

- `tamagui` for cross-platform views, themes and animations
- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- Expo SDK 44
- Next.js 12
- React Navigation 6

## 🗂 Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native)
- `next` (web)

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `ui` includes your custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## 🏁 Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev: `yarn native`
  - Runs `expo start`

## Developing

We've added `packages/ui` to show an example of [building your own design system](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems).

You need to watch it to have changes propagate, we've added a root `watch` command you should run in a separate terminal alongside the apps:

```bash
yarn watch
```

If you want to see Tamagui extract, try running `yarn web:optimize` and put a debug pragma at the top of `packages/app/features/home.tsx`, like so:

```tsx
// debug
```

You'll see lots of output including the compiled HTML, CSS and all the steps it takes to get there.

## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

See `packages/ui` named `@my/ui` for how this works.

## 🆕 Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

## 🧐 Why use Expo + Next.js?
